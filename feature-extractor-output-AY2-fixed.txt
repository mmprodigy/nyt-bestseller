But someone is waiting for her...<br /><br />A woman is found dead in her bath, a small child crying in the room next door... Is it an accidental death or the perfect murder?<br /><br />When WPC Jane Tennison is promoted to the role of Detective Constable in London's Bow Street CID, she is immediately conflicted. While her far more experienced colleagues move on swiftly from one criminal case to another, Jane is often left with doubts about their findings.<br /><br />Becoming inextricably embroiled in a multiple-rape case, Jane must put her life at risk in the search for answers. Will she toe the CID line, or endanger her position by seeking the truth...?", u'1655', u'4.16', u'1105', [(u'to-read', 347), (u'currently-reading', 83)], [u'\n           \n           In the 1990s, I fell in love with Prime Suspect. I loved Jane Tennison, played by the incredible actress Helen Mirren. I was inspired. Seriously who wasn\u2019t a little in awe of Jane then. Lynda La Plante has brought back to life Jane Tennison, filling in the detail about what made her such a strong, gutsy and formidable character! Hidden Killers follows on from Tennison beautifully.So we met Jane Tennison back in 1973, as a probationer joining the Metropolitan Police Force. In Tennison, we saw her learning the ropes in Hackney, getting involved with her boss and getting in on all of the action. Time has moved on in Hidden Killers. Jane is now at the end of her two year probationary period, with CID in her sights. Jane finds herself acting as a decoy prostitute, to capture a man wanted for sexual assault. Cue Jane in her sister\u2019s borrowed going out clubbing clothes. Once in CID, Jane finds herself working a case, that no one else seems to believe is remotely suspicious. A young mother has been found dead in a bath, apparently drowned. Jane starts to dig, taking her absolute belief in evidence backing up theory and in the truth.Anyone who was a fan of the original Prime Suspect series should be reading both Tennison and Hidden Killers. This really feels like Jane. It is a credit to Lynda La Plante, that she captures the essence of Jane so perfectly. It is Jane Tennison. We see Jane in a man\u2019s world, surrounded by 1970s era prejudice. Once Jane gets her teeth into a case, she won\u2019t let go. We know this from Prime Suspect and we see it here. She follows her gut instinct on a suspicious death and keeps on pushing. No one can stand in her way.Bloody fantastic! More Jane Tennison please. Totally recommended!\n         ', u'\n           \n           One of my top six books last year was Tennison by Lynda LaPlante. As a fan of the (ahem) older Jane Tennison via LaPlante\u2019s Prime Suspect series I loved that she\u2019d leapt back in time, allowing us to meet a young Jane and giving us the opportunity to understand how the popular character of the 1990s became so resilient\u2026 not to mention a bit of a hard-arse.Happily LaPlante is now offering up another episode in the life of young Jane \u2013 with her passion for justice and occasional disdain for authority \u2013 as she continues to doggedly pursue the baddies.It\u2019s interesting (as I said in my review of Tennison) to have opportunity to reflect on the role of women in the police service \u2013 and society in general \u2013 in the early 1970s. And Jane\u2019s still pushing boundaries and breaking through barriers in this outing.Again we\u2019re offered two cases. I struggled with this a little in Tennison, but it works well here; as the two investigations are paced very differently. The serial rapist case is essentially closed fairly early in the book, but Jane\u2019s tying together loose ends in her own time. And then there\u2019s the case her colleagues are eager to label as unsuspicious\u2026 a decision Jane disagrees with and is determined to prove.But it\u2019s the character of Jane that makes this novel a wonderful read She\u2019s tenacious and details-oriented. And her ethics mean she doesn\u2019t cut corners and won\u2019t be satisfied with anything less than the truth\u2026 and justice. We slowly see however, that she\u2019s learning to play the game.I loved spending time with Jane again and only regret another year or so may pass until she returns to the page!Read the full review on my site: http://www.debbish.com/books-literatu...4.5 stars\n', u"\n           \n           Very enjoyable following Tennison's move up the ranks. \n         ", u'\n           \n           The second of the Tennison prequel books - and a Hackney case and a Bow Street case see her become a fully fledged CID detective. I think the book was too long for the plot at nearly 500 pages - it seemed a little slow-moving at times.\n         ', u'\n           \n           This was a present, so unfortunately I felt compelled to read right through, but dear me, this is turgid crap. I\'d have had more fun having teeth pulled. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:1) The English. This is dreadful. Being able to tell the difference between past and present tense would be a desirable trait in an author. The proper use of punctuation instead of endless conjunctives is to be preferred. And knowing what are words and what are not is also a fantastic place to begin - have a hint, "Tarra" is not a word.2) The Narrative. This is even more dreadful. Wrapped up in English that would make a teenager blush, a good two thirds of the book seems to be spent just recapping what has happened for those not paying attention before. And not just recapping - oh no. Spelling out the most minute of details ("...and you got the coat back, as you\'re wearing it") in the most painstaking of ways, nothing, but nothing may be left the reader to guess, assume or infer, nothing must be shown, everything must be told always. Because if we aren\'t told that she\'s touching her lip because her lip was injured in the attack, we might forget that her lip was injured in the attack. It hasn\'t been mentioned for three pages after all.3) The Characters. Not for a very long time has a main character annoyed me more. Smug, self-righteous, the only one able to see the truth with her whole two months of experience, this is a Mary-Sue to end all Mary-Sues. The other characters are no better. Wooden, archetypal, and mainly there to highlight how wonderful our main character is - even though, even as the author writes her, she comes across as smug, self-righteous and generally insufferable.4) The Plot. It\'s not even worth my time giving spoilers. If your whole plot rests on characters randomly bumping into each other at random times just as the plot happens to need that to occur and for no other reason than because you can\'t be bothered to come up with a plausible way for them to meet, it\'s not a plot.On the whole, this book isn\'t so much a book or a story as a collection of words thrown together.

Most of the authors were new to me, but a few are some of my favorites, so this was a great variety of stories for me. I really liked Phoenix and Maggie in Liz Schulte\'s "Psyche Souffle." I\'m not familiar with the series, but it seemed like Phoenix made a grand gesture, and I\'d like to see what happens next. If reality TV shows were anything near as wonderful as Deanna Chase\'s "A Bourbon Street Valentine" I might actually watch them. It was fun to spend the day in Kat\'s life, especially when something exciting and crazy was happening. Tricia O\'Malley\'s "Tequila Shots & Valentine Knots" had a very exciting cast of characters. With this small taste of the chaos they find themselves in, I would imagine there is never a dull moment. Delaney and Hugh in "The Vampire\'s Valentine Surprise" by Kristen Painter made me want to move to their town. I definitely want to see more of them. Barbara Annino\'s "Deadly Diamonds" was fantastic. I don\'t know what I would have done if I was Stacy and had those three sisters training me like that. It was a crazy situation, but I enjoyed reading it. Christina Miller\'s "Kidnapping Cupid" was very funny and snarky. I loved it. Rose Pressey\'s "Forever Valentine" was exciting, fun and mysterious. "Romance By the Bay" by Tonya Kappes was perfect. The magic, the pets, and the romance made for a fantastic story. I liked that there was a whole town of supernatural in Renee George\'s "My Furry Valentine." The characters found a lot of trouble, so there was never a dull moment. Michele Bardsley\'s "Cupid\'s Valentine" was super hot. I liked the story of Karee and Bret\'s relationship. Finally, is "Cold Flame" by Ann Charles. I can\'t help but want to know how the chase between Zoe and Reid plays out, and what happens to Violet. I\'m willing to bet it is pretty complicated and entertaining. I received this book in exchange for an honest review.\n         ', u'\n           \n           A fun Valentine\'s day anthology with some of my favorites! There is something in here for everyone but it is a MUST GET for fans of Kristen Painter\'s Nocturne Falls series. There is a Hugh and Delaney short in here!!

It\'s easy to see the difference in quality and depth if you read Ann Charles\' "Cold Flame" and then the others.

And it\'s Cupid\'s love life that needs fixing\u2026 Cute.Deanna Chase\'s "A Bourbon Street Valentine" finds Kat Hart, a jewelry designer, doing box office business on Valentine\'s Day. Turns out Eros has his own agenda for Valentine\'s Day and hosts his very own reality show.The idea was cute, but it was too hokey for me.Tricia O\'Malley\'s "Tequila Shots & Valentine\'s Knots" is all about the Lonely Hearts party on Valentine\'s Day in Tequila Key where it gets out of hand, turning into an orgy of love.It had its cute moments, but there was too many bits and pieces of back history that didn\'t really provide me with any meat.Kristen Painter\'s "The Vampire\'s Valentine Surprise" finds Delaney Bellingham, a vampire, worked up over a bake-off. This is a sweet \u2014 I know, I know, I\'ve already said "sweet" \u2014 story about life in a small town as Painter introduces us to the townspeople and their interactions. It\'s a dip into their lives, but at least it\'s a complete story.Barbra Annino\'s "Deadly Diamonds" takes a while to reveal each hint about the character. Turns out that Great-aunt Fiona is being held hostage by six knives and the ghost of an ex-love. Another cute story about family. And could use some growing up.Christiana Miller\'s "Kidnapping Cupid" is definitely an oops. God knows, I\'d like to kill Eros what with that mouth of his! Seems he comes in three flavors: young, teenaged, and adult. It also explains why we need a Cupid to find love. And that\'s just one of the stories in this short. The Devil shows up here as well, and he reminds me of an Eve Langlais story.Rose Pressey\'s "Forever Valentine" finds Halloween LaVeau throwing a party where some joker screws up the spell on the cookies. There\'s a lot of tell in this and could also use some growing up.Tonya Kappes\'s "Romance by the Bay" finds a tourist bringing his dog in for an emergency to the one vet who can talk to him. The dog, I mean. It\'s another cozy story in a small town with the added benefit of talking pets. It\'s sweet how the town jumps in and tries to help when the shelter is threatened, but again, it could use some growing up in this tale of true love."Not like my idiot human who thought it was smart to give me a chicken tender. Sure, I begged for it, but I\'m a dog. Idiot."I gotta remember this when my cats are giving me the stinkeye. Whatever does Kappes mean when she says "he donated everything but this land"? Wouldn\'t it make more sense that he hadn\'t donated the land so they could stay?Renee George\'s "My Furry Valentine" is a run-up to the Valentine Day\'s wedding of Sunny Haddock and Babel Trimmel with all the issues and family problems. This is a sweet one, with yes, the small town of shifters that step up to help out. Only there is more to the Trimmel family history than anyone suspected.Michele Bardsley\'s "Cupid\'s Valentine" finds Aphrodite pushing for romance in the Mile-Hi Club between rival magazine editors. While it\'s a cute story \u2014 I love the ending, Bardsley\'s telling and the major lack of proofreading was distracting "too be honest".Ann Charles\'s "Cold Flame" is a back history into how Zoe Parker met Reid Martin of the glass jaw and shying nature. This one was a pip and the best of the bunch. I gotta put her on my TBR.The Cover and TitleThe cover is vivid in its gradation of sky blue down to the bright fuchsia at the bottom with a vertical curtain of rain giving a Matrix-like feel to the background. A sexy cartoon witch in trademark witch\'s hat with its fuchsia ribbon and flower, a long ponytail of red hair curling around her ankles and her red-violet mini dress atop thigh-high zippered FM boots is waving her star-topped wand as a black cat lies at her feet.The title is the theme for this anthology of short stories, the Kiss and Spell of Valentine\'s Day.\n         ', u"\n           \n           DELICIOUSLY CUTE, FABULOUSLY FUNNY AND DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING !!!Title: Kiss and SpellDesignation: A Valentine's Holiday collection of eleven standalone short storiesAuthor: Multiple AuthorsMy Rating: FIVE FABULOUS STARS*****Oh my!

I LOVE IT! Just a heartfelt story of friendship. Can't wait to share this with my bookstore customers! \n         ", u"\n           \n           This book was fun! Ultimately a quick, enjoyable read and even a little scary at times. I loved the inclusion of the graphic novel element and I loved that it mostly kept me guessing. I wished there had been at least one more twist because it felt like everything came together a bit too easily and that the main characters were extremely trusting of this random jackdaw guy, but like I said - still enjoyable.My only real complaint was HOW HARD this author was trying to prove they know Seattle - if I made a drinking game out of the completely unnecessary obscure Seattle references in this book, I would be dead by now. It was insane - and hilarious. It's Seattle, we get it. Except you clearly don't know Seattle because you committed the fatal flaw of saying it always rains/we never see the sun. Really? You reference an old Seattle newspaper that went out of print in 2009 but can't look up basic Seattle weather? Nice try. ;)\n         ", u'\nI had a severe case of "Uh oh Cait you didn\'t read the blurb did you" for this book. I\'m embarrassed. I\'M SORRY. I thought it\'d be about two nerdy friends who were into internet comics and geekness and nerdom. Buuuuut...it\'s actually a murder mystery where a girl tries to find her "presumed dead" best friend who is leaving her messages through online comic strips. Because why would you text, fren. Why. This is way more dramatic and flashy. And like SURE that\'s not what I anticipated, but the reason I didn\'t like it was honestly the style. It\'s just really really really TELLING. The first 3 chapters are ALL telling what happened. And most of the book is too, so you just don\'t get to connect with the characters or see them become complex. Where fore art thou, emotions. It means I, the reader, am so not going to get lost in a story when it\'s all told, not shown. And it\'s like barely over 200pgs. SO. My bowl of cereal had more character development. Because I ate it. I didn\'t eat this book. (It\'s a library book, tbh, that\'s the only reason I didn\'t gnaw on the cover for my afternoon snack.)However I absolutely LOVED the art! I love how there were panels throughout the book and honestly if the story had just been a comic of Princess X, it would\'ve been #fab.Also May\'s BFF is biracial, Japanese/Caucasian and so is the comic hero, Princess X, so it was nice to have diversity! Also no romance which was sUPER REFRESHING.I just wasn\'t even caring about the storyline though. May gets this random boy to help her find track down the owner of the mysterious iamprincessx.com site who she thinks is run by her presumed dead BFF...but like. Why was he helpign mate. There was literally nothing in it for him. Unless this book is populated by a cabbage, I NEED MOTIVES. And all the running about the city, getting chased by cars and going underground and into abandon houses etc. etc. just felt super overdone. Complex characters can hide a multitude of sins in a dry plot but nah sir here.ANYHOW! There are comics and there is murder! And this can honestly be a case of "well this wasn\'t a me book" so in which case, go for it when you try it! I need layers. Like parfait. Omg I could do with parfait right now.\n         ', u"\nDear Princess X, My 2.5 rating may be not all your fault, I think it's just me..with excellent pretty looking book overall design..With a premise that deserves 5 StarsMay & Libby were best friends, created their own comic character Princess X, then Libby died in an accident..3 years later, May finds out posters and a fuss over a webcomics about the same character Libby used to draw, The Princess X\nI'd have rate it higher,but just if it was half the pages count..just a novella..that'd be a very entertaining better read. The story main plot is good, even the set up for it came fast that I thought the rest of the novel will be fast packed with actions..alas, it wasn't as I expected..The Story--------Three years after her best friend died, May start seeing the character they created together Princess X everywhere from Posters, Stickers even Graffiti. And an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com.The more May explores the webcomic, the more she sees disturbing similarities between Libby's real life story and Princess X online. Even the drawings was the same of Libby's..With help of her next door computer genius, Trick, they try to unsolve the story behind the site..and the person who running this phenomenon..and hoping that would lead to her best friend, Libby, who lives.It was really fine mystery, but it solve itself after very few chapters, pretty too early..thanks to the Princess X comics that was not-so-symbolic, obviously clearing the story of what happened to Libby after the accident.Then comes the hunt for the 4 keys that would lead May to the Princess X...with a help of don't-call-me-dude-countless-times Patrick who have even a better character set up and development more than May and Libby.The hunt was a bit slow written ,too much describing the places which was fine by me in longer and bit different kind of novels, but here in a YA fun mystery set in real life was a bit longer than it should be.-I didn't mind though the fun described city of Seattle and the fun facts about where Starbucks was started. Or The Fremont Troll, I liked these tours-Also some of the mentioning of the Dark Net interested me, since I encountered with it previously with Stephen King's Mr. Mercedes..and later in Night Film.But even as the mystery and the hunt unfolded and things started to heat up by the cemetery scene... we back to the slow pace writing and even introduced to a new character in length that was in my opinion totally unnecessary.. add this to a typical unrealistic Hollywood climax that was better concluded into faster paced comic better than these many pages.May I didn't feel the novel make good use of the excellent character development of Patrick in the story or may be I didn't feel much the emotional part between May and Libby enough.All in all made me disappointed a bit for such highly anticipated read...since I like some YA Novels,specially when the plot seems original and promising, and the romance part is minor like in this case..but something went wrong for me and even felt a bit bored. So it may be just me, right? May be iI just anticipate it would be faster or more convenient to me.I still would recommend to give it a try if it's promising enough to you..\nTo Princess X, With love,Mohammed ArabeyFrom 11 November 2015to 15 November 2015\n", u"\n           \n           I read almost the entire book in one sitting. It's that intense. That good. The pacing is perfect and I adored the illustrations; it's partially a graphic novel. This is a girl power book for anyone and everyone. I loved that it was a YA book about friendship, too, without any romance stuff at all. There are guy characters and no attraction involved!The only negative (kinda?) is that I now want a full Princess X graphic novel. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'36788149', u'Wholesale Price List of Seeds, 1902 (Classic Reprint)', u' ', u'\n17400364\nF H Ebeling Company\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17400364.F_H_Ebeling_Company\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2017', u'10', u'27', u'Forgotten Books', u'Excerpt from Wholesale Price List of Seeds, 1902<br /><br />No; Syracuse, Dewitt, East Syracuse, Fayetteville, Van Buren, Liverpool Collamer, Onondaga, Cedarvale, \'<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The opposite of a great truth is another truth." - Niels BohrI was thinking about Dante the other day and wondering how one could approach him from the angle of a GoodReads review. One of the obvious problems is that he lived a long time ago, and many of the cultural referents have changed. You\'re constantly having to think "Well, nowadays what he\'s saying would correspond to THAT". It isn\'t so bad in Hell, when there is plenty of entertainment to be had in seeing how the different sins are punished, and indulging your schadenfreude. Then Purgatory tells a moral story that\'s more or less timeless if you go for that sort of thing, but once you arrive in Paradise it starts getting seriously tricky. A lot of the stuff at first sight just seems irrelevant to the 21st century world... all these explanations about the mechanics of Ptolomaic astronomy, and Dante querying the inhabitants of Heaven on obscure theological points. It\'s notorious that readers most often give up somewhere in the third book. I started wondering if there was any modern-day author one could identify with Dante, and if that might help us connect to his concerns. And in fact, I do have a suggestion that some people will no doubt condemn out of hand as completely heretical: Richard Dawkins. Now of course, I am aware that Dante was deeply immersed in the Christian world-view, and Dawkins is famous for being the world\'s most outspoken atheist. But it\'s not quite as crazy as it first may seem. Dante was a Christian to the core of his being, but he was furious with the way the Church was being run; he put several of its leaders, notably Pope Boniface VIII, in Hell. On the other side, I challenge anyone to read "The Ancestor\'s Tale" to the end, and not, at least for a moment, entertain the idea that Dawkins is in actual fact a deeply religious man. He admits as much himself: as he puts it, it\'s often not so much that he disagrees with conventionally religious people, more that "they are saying it wrong". Amen to that.As noted, both Dante and Dawkins are extremely unhappy with the way mainstream religion is being organized. The other characteristic that unites them for me is this passionate love for science. One has to remember that, for Dante, Ptolomaic astronomy was state of the art stuff, and the details of the angelic hierarchy were a topic of vital importance; of course he cross-examines the hosts of the blessed to find out more. These days, I imagine he would be trying to get inside information on what happened during the Big Bang before spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred, whether or not the Higgs particle really exists, and how evolution produced human intelligence. For Dante, there didn\'t seem to be any opposition between religious faith and science - they were part of the same thing. I do wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to learn that many leading religious figures, even in the early 21st century, reject a large part of science as being somehow unreligious. It\'s wrong to spend your life dispassionately trying to understand God\'s Universe? I can see him getting quite angry about this, and deciding to rearrange the seating a little down in Hell.I keep thinking that there\'s a book someone ought to write called "Five Atheists You\'ll Meet in Heaven". Please let me know when it comes out; I\'ll buy a copy at once.**************************************PS I couldn\'t help wondering what Paradise might have looked like if Dante had been writing today. Obviously we wouldn\'t have the old geocentric model of the Universe - it would be bang up to date. I think there is now far more material for an ambitious poet to work with than there was in the 14th century. For example, when we get to the Heaven of the Galaxy, I imagine him using this wonderful fact that all the heavy elements are made in supernova explosions. "We are all stardust", as some people like to put it. Then when we get to the Heaven of the Cosmos, we find that the light from the "Let there be light" moment at the beginning of Creation is still around - it\'s just cooled to 2.7 degrees K, and appears as the cosmic background radiation. But it\'s not completely uniform, as the quantum fluctuations left over from the period when the Universe was the size of an atomic nucleus are the beginnings of the galaxies created on the second day. Finally, we reach the Heaven of the Multiverse, and find that we are just one of many different universes. It was necessary to create all of them, so that random processes could make sure that a very small number would end up being able to support life. How impious to assume that God would only be able to create one Universe, and have to tweak all the constants Himself!\n', u'\n           \n           I once thought I\'d write an essay on how long it takes a serious author (of fiction or nonfiction) before he or she inevitably quotes Dante. If I were to write a novel myself (this is a hypothetical grammatical construction!), I\'d probably manage about a page before I\'d exclaim that I am lost, and middle-aged, and in the middle of a dark forest. I\'d try to kill off annoying acquaintances and punish them severely for their lack of admiration for me and my creativity (not to mention my sarcasm and irony!!), and of course I would meet my teenage love and be joined together forever in eternal happiness in the end (or maybe not, come to think of it, I might skip that part!), after spending a life travelling the underworld in the company of the most brilliant author I can think of. Dante fulfilled all his (and my!) dreams with the Divina Commedia, and I envy him his bravery and talent, not to mention his ability to write in that beautiful Italian. However, not all parts of the poem were equally appealing to me.I found myself loving Inferno, liking Purgatorio, and not quite identifying with Paradiso at all.I always wondered why that is, and concluded that humans are much better at depicting hell than heaven, chaos than order, dystopia than utopia. Reason being, in my (not very important) opinion: there\'s no storyline behind real bliss, and without stories, we are not entirely connected to humanity and its questions anymore. Paradiso is nice, but uninteresting, sort of."Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che entrate" - the ticket to hell: I doubt if there ever was a better advertisement for a rollercoaster adventure!Update in Year One Of Post-Truth Wall Building:I am still lost in that dark forest of middle age, trying to make sense of life, and Dante comes to mind more and more often, in the same way Orwell\'s 1984 does: it grows more realistic with every day that passes. This morning, "The Wall Of Dis" all of a sudden forced itself upon my thoughts, - the great wall separating Dante\'s Upper and Lower Hell. Upper Hell is for the Carnal, Gluttonous, Greedy, and Wrathful, whereas the other side of the wall contains the Heretical, Violent, Fraudulent and Treacherous. It just struck me that every wall in the world has created that kind of "mental division". The typical representatives of "upper hell", consumed by the everyday sins of wanting most of everything for themselves without being bothered by others, usually keep their "moral upper hand" by accusing the "other side of the wall" of worse crimes, such as the "wrong religion", violence, and treason.The funny (or sad) thing is that it works both ways. You can turn hell upside down and have the same results: egotistical, narcissistic angry men accuse others of treason and heresy to deflect from their own faults. No wonder Inferno is a timeless classic: after all, Dante based it on his own experience of a divisive, violent political situation.\n         ', u'\nTHE DARING, somewhat COMIC, and also DIVINE, INVENTIOIt is very difficult not to be lured by the highly intelligent craft of Durante degli Aliguieri (DA). And may be it is not a coincidence that he was the exact contemporary of Giotto, his fellow Florentine. For if Giotto planted the seed for a pictorial representation of the world in which man, at the center, and through a window, delivers to us a naturalistic depiction of divine stories, Dante also used his writing to posit himself as the Author who through his fictional persona or Alter-Ego, gives us the viewpoint to contemplate the full cosmos. His cosmos, but for us to share.Still, we modern readers, in spite of Modernist and PostModernist awareness, are still fooled by DA\u2019s handling of illusion, and easily become pilgrims and start on a literary trip more than ready to absorb everything that DA wants us to see, and think, and believe.POLITICSSo, for example, we will learn his political views. DA was exiled in 1301 and led a peripatetic life, outside Florence, until his death in 1321. He wrote the Commedia during the exile, from 1309 and finished it in time. By masterfully welding the fact and mythologized fiction of the world of Antiquity, he cloths himself with the full robes of Auctoritas, and presents us the complex development of European politics during the thirteenth century. He summons his views repeatedly either by the succession of visits to the traitors or in fully developed historical pageants.Of course, Hell is populated by DA\u2019s enemies, with the very pope responsible for his exile, Boniface VIII, holding stardom in Circle 8th. In this Inferno DA is the very Minos. He is the one who with his pen of many tails wraps around his enemies and throws them down the pit to the Circle that DA believes the chosen sinners deserve. Even if this spectacle horrifies his ingenuous Pilgrim.The ranking of the Inferno Circles reflect also DA\u2019s values. Lust is the least damaging while Treason, in particular political treason and the betrayal of friends, is the most despicable. In comparison even Lucifer, a rendition that remains faithful to the medieval tradition, is not much more than a grotesque, and not particularly hateful, monster. Politics continue in Purgatory. DA\u2019s audacity is again proved by the way he exploits to its fullest what was still a relatively new concept in Christian dogma (1274). If DA had been Minos in Inferno, he now is the discerning Cato of Purgatory. He is the one holding the Silver and Gold keys, and who claims to know the very intimate thought of those who had the luck to repent the instance just before dying. He awards then the transit ticket to Paradise. Can we be surprised if some of the awardees had some relation to those figures who had welcomed DA during his exile? DA\u2019s authorial knowledge is supplemented by the granting his protagonist with the role of Messenger of Hope. The Pilgrim, as the only human in Purgatory, can bid for more prayers to the still living relatives when he goes back to Earth. He can effect a change in the duration that any purging sinner is to spend in the transitional stage, the only one of the three realms in which the clock is ticking.Could one expect DA to finally drop the political discourse in Heaven? No, of course not. There it even acquires greater strength since the discourse is cloaked with a divine mantle. In Paradiso it will be no other than Saint Peter himself who will denounce the path of degeneration that the Papacy had taken in recent years. And if Boniface VIII (died in 1303) had been repeatedly identified as the culprit for the evil in earth, now it is his succeeding popes, --and contemporary to the writing of Commedia--, who are selected by DA\u2019s saintly mouthpiece. Pope Clement V was responsible for the transfer of the papacy to Avignon, and the cupidity of John XXII was for everyone to see. Indeed, a secluded Apocalyptical 666 attests that politics forms a triptych in Commedia. In agreement with the intricate framework of parallels, symmetries and balances in this work, DA devoted the three chapters 6 in each book to political diatribes.Apart from his relying on Ancient Auctoritas, DA also accorded the full weight of history to his views, and it is mostly in a couple of major pageants and in the Valley of the Kings that he exposes the political disaster that the withdrawal from the Italian peninsula by the Empire had on the various city states. It was left to the corrupt papacy and to the corrupt smaller kingdoms to spread crime along the full Europe. His solution was clear. The papacy had to govern only religious matters, and he extolled the Emperor Henry VII to hold the political reins of Europe. It is DA\u2019s canonized Beatrice who has a reserved seat for this Emperor in God\u2019s White Flower if he does succeed in exerting his salvific political role.DOGMABut the Commedia is not just about politics. This extremely complex work is also soaking in Christian Dogma. Of course politics and dogma were inextricably joined during the Middle Ages, and that was part of DA\u2019s very complaint. And what is to me extraordinary about the immediate reception of Commedia, is that it was treated like Scripture. Even the early editions were illustrated like illuminated manuscripts\u2014which in a way is most befitting if we remember that it is about the progress of a Pilgrim\u2019s as he approaches Light and gains a 20/20 vision elevated tho the Trinitarian power.In his appeal to religious dogma DA was extraordinarily successful, even if some of his claims were shockingly daring. He modified or added realms to the Christian Cosmos, with the peculiar understanding of the  Limbo to accommodate revered figures from Ancient Antiquity, or added the Pre-Purgatory for the unabsolved Rulers. He designed his own ranking of the Sins, both for Hell and Purgatory. But most importantly he proposed his understanding of Free Will and its conflicting relationship to Predetermination and God\u2019s vision. Not by chance did he place the discussion of Free Will at the very center of the work, in Canto 16 of Purgatory.But the most dangerous proposition, for him, was his vehement defense of the limitations of the Papacy on Earth. He started writing in 1307 just a few years after the Papal Bull of Unam Sanctam the very controversial claim of papal infallibility. Not this book, but Dante\u2019s Monarchia, in which he strongly attacked official tenet, was burned soon after Dante\u2019s death and was included in the list of forbidden books during the 16th century.NARRATIVE SCHEMESTo us, however, it is not his proclamations on Dogma, and not even his political views (except for historians), which offer the greatest interest. What is most remarkable for literature addicts is how DA, the author, develops all these themes, and succeeds in weighing with the gravest authority his poetic treatise. And this he does through his masterful manipulation of the power of fiction and the sophisticated uses of voices.For a start, there is the protagonist: DA\u2019s Alter Ego, and the only human in the full work. His humanity, and his being in the middle of the moral mess in which he has placed himself is the perfect mirror for the reader. But we can trust him to embody us because Virgil, the greatest Roman poet and chronologist of the foundation of Rome, will guide us. We can trust him also because Christian Divinity has selected him as the, temporary, guide. It is only when Virgil\u2019s powers have reached his limits, two thirds into the full work, that the pilgrim\u2019s identity is revealed to us. He is Dante himself, or Dante the Pilgrim (DP). With his revealed identity he can say goodbye to the pagan guide who cannot, alas, have a place in Heaven. Dante, however, will.The spoiler provided by our general culture has damaged the way we read the work. The astounding pretention of DA in assigning himself the powers in deciding who goes where in his system of divine retributions has been blurred to some naive readers. Some of them try to excuse Dante precisely because they have been entirely convinced by his acting puppet. The highly successful Dante the Pilgrim (DP) as a candid personality with the qualities of kindness, fear, anger and similar emotions, distracts our attention away from the real Dante, the Author.The Pilgrim is an alibi mechanism for his creator. He shows pity for the people DA condemns. He can go beyond the Terrace of Pride, in which the rather proud DA may be still spending some of his time. And he becomes the anointed messenger from the Heavens to deliver to us what DA is writing. But we would also be mistaken if we did not recognized that not always him, but many other characters voice DA\u2019s opinion. His brilliant dramatization with innumerable personages constitutes the choir of a ventriloquist. In the sophisticated Narrative technique, the handling of time is also magisterial. Apart from the symbolic unfolding of the action during Holy Week of the year 1300, and the references to eternal cosmic time, it is the numerous voices of this clever ventriloquist who continually foretell what is to happen to the sinners. Most outstandingly the voices predict the eternal condemnation of DA\u2019s particular enemies. Some of these were not yet dead at the time of the pilgrimage, but had already passed away when DA was writing his poem. Such an example is the premonition that the most hated pope Boniface VIII will be damned. He died three years later. But there is also the shocking case of the soul that is already in penance while his body is still living on earth. This personality died even after Dante.Finally it is DP himself, once he has entered Heaven, who engages in this foretelling, and of course, it had to be in his warning to the Popes that were about to be in power in the years after the voyage of the Commedia, reminding them to stay out of politics and to forget material wealth.The suitability of DP as our Alter-egos to reach salvation is certified by his examinations on the Theological Virtues by the the Apostles Peter, James and John. He passes them with flying colors, because DP acknowledges that his knowledge is based on the Holy Text.And it is also with Text, and DA was very well versed in exploiting its four levels of interpretation (Literal, allegorical, moral and anagogical), that is, with this new poetry that Dante Aliguieri is proposing a plan for his, and our, salvation. Because after such a heavenly Graduation who can deny the Commedia its status as Prophetic and Scriptural? May be we saw it coming, when the still anonymous Pilgrim posited himself, at the very beginning of the poem, as the 6th greatest poet after the likes of Homer, Ovid, Virgil etc. So, may be it is not by chance that his identity as Dante is revealed until Virgil is used and expensed.Several other poets also populate the triptychal poem: representatives of the two pioneering schools of Proven\xe7al and Sicilian schools, as well as by those Florentines who with or just before DA, started formulating the sweet new style (dolce still novo) and exploring the literary possibilities of the still vernacular Tuscan tongue. But if DA has been exploiting his abilities as ventriloquist, it is with his own voice as a poet that he makes a presence in Commedia. A few of his fictional characters quote some of Dante\u2019s earlier verses.Having reached the Empirium of the poem, we can stop and think about where Dante Alighieri has taken us. Because, even if not eternal salvation, he has delivered us a most extraordinary feat of literature that we cannot but qualify as divine. Furthermore, he has done so in a newly coined language, to which he added some words of his own invention, and, most outstanding of all, he positioned the Author at the very center of that literary White Rose of fiction.And this flower continued to exude its rich scent until, in a similar process to the displacement of Giotto\u2019s viewer, Roland Barthes, plucked it in the declaration formulated in his 1967 Essay The Death of the Author.But before that, it had a long life.\n', u'\n           \n           \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0645\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0627

Si alguien tiene la inmensa suerte de leer la edici\xf3n ilustrada por Gustave Dor\xe9, llega al Para\xedso como si acompa\xf1ara a Dante buscando a Beatriz. El Purgatorio es tan, pero tan bueno, que me atrap\xf3. Dante describe los siete pecados capitales de forma tan maravillosa... El Para\xedso es el la parte que menos gusta. Muchos la consideran tediosa y de una carga teol\xf3gica muy alta (bueno, estas eran las convicciones de Dante en la \xe9poca).Es cierto tambi\xe9n que por la obra desfila una larga galer\xeda de personajes que no conocemos, por eso, es muy importante contar con una edici\xf3n que contenga notas aclaratorias, sobre todo de orden hist\xf3rico m\xe1s que mitol\xf3gicas o aleg\xf3ricas.La elecci\xf3n de Virgilio no est\xe1 hecha para nada al azar. S\xf3lo un poeta de ese calibre podr\xeda haber acompa\xf1ado a Dante al Infierno. Recordemos la brillantez de Virgilio para retratar el descenso de Eneas, quien tambi\xe9n baja a los infiernos para ir a buscar a su padre Anquises, en el sexto cap\xedtulo de la Eneida.Yo le\xed una interesante edici\xf3n de La Divina Comedia, publicada por Editorial Losada en tres libros, con el agregado de aclaratorias notas adicionales.Es menester leer La Divina Comedia junto con el Fausto de Goethe y El Para\xedso Perdido de Milton, cuando de cl\xe1sicos de esta naturaleza se habla.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'30476726', u'Mexico, Texas, Canada: Message from the President of the United States, Transmitting the Information Required by a Resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th of January Instant, &C', u'58', u'\n15331800\nBuren Martin Van Buren\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15331800.Buren_Martin_Van_Buren\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'4', u'25', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The five men who committed the robbery are hardened criminals belonging to an eastern European syndicate. CHURCH, in his effort to unravel the elaborate criminal network supporting the operation, clashes with leaders of the gang in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles. A ransom of twenty-million dollars is demanded in exchange for the return of the jewelry. A deadline of one week compels CHURCH to move fast in pursuit of the diamonds. Aided by a female FBI agent and a Russian mixed martial arts expert, CHURCH's quest for the diamonds takes him from the international diamond bourses of Antwerp and Amsterdam to the gang's headquarters on the Adriatic coast. Along the way, deadly exchanges of gunfire leave bodies from Las Vegas to Trieste.", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'18430205', u'Grimm, Volume 1: The Coins of Zakynthos', u'112', u'\n156278\nDavid Greenwalt\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/156278.David_Greenwalt\n3.67\n154\n41\n', u'2013', u'11', u'19', u'Dynamite Entertainment', u'Never-before-told stories, set in the world of the acclaimed NBC series, <i> Grimm</i>, by the show creators themselves!

As both are written by the same people, I would assume that this story is canonical and meant to be an add-on to the TV series, though it is hard to tell exactly where this story would fit in timeline-wise. It\'s one problem, but not an insurmountable one. The story mostly resolves around the hunt for the Coins of Zakynthos, which can convey great power to anyone who holds them, which is why Nick Burkhardt and his team must destroy them. The coins were introduced to the Grimm back story some time ago, but has recently received less plot time than the Adalind baby plot (and if you don\'t know what that is then why are you reading this comic?). Nick, Hank and Monroe travel to Europe after receiving a message from Nick\'s mother. They team up with her and the Wesen resistance against the Royals and their hunting dogs, along with another mysterious female Grimm Maya, who needless to say, is not to be trusted. The artwork on this is pretty good, with most of the characters being recognisable with the exception of Nick, but the actor that plays him is pretty bland in looks anyway, so this isn\'t much of an issue. I have more of a problem with the depiction of Maya in stilettos and stockings, and what\'s with the "Fwrum" sound that every Wesen makes when they Woge (change into their beast form)? It\'s nice to see Nick\'s mum Kelly return to the story, after being missing for most of season 3 (as I type this the character is about to return in the next episode), and Hank and Monroe make a pretty good backup team. I would have liked to have seen more of the other characters in the series (Juliette is entirely absent).There is a single prologue story that involves a Wesen wedding, which has nice resonances with the Monroe and Roselee wedding plans.Overall, not a bad story. 3 stars\n         ', u'\n           \n           Another exciting grimm adventure \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0fFinally i got the answers i was looking forThe fate of the coins of zakynthos is revealed Really miss the show\U0001f494\U0001f494\U0001f494\n         ', u'\n           \n           Grimm Volume 1 is a collection of comics based on the hit television series. When a tie-in is made, the questions that come to mind are, is it any good? Is it a money grab by a studio or is it written by someone who understands the characters and world of the show? I have seen a few episodes of the show, so I have a faint knowledge of the show and it\u2019s characters. The book seems to ring through fine, while also offering a larger scope story than you would find in a typical episode. I don\u2019t know how often they travel internationally on the show, but most show budgets don\u2019t allow such things very often.There is a nice intro story, then the group ends up heading to Europe to find some coins. The coins are dangerous and need to be destroyed. The problem is there are factions that want to use the coin for evil or seemingly good. There are lots of face offs with monsters. There are loyalty shifts. It\u2019s pretty violent at times.It\u2019s not a bad story. It seems to add some backstory that the show may not have told. Whether that fits in with the canon and universe of the show. The art is good. I\u2019m not sure it looks like the main characters from the show, but that could be just me. I enjoyed the story.I was given a review copy of this graphic novel by Diamond Book Distributors and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for letting me review this graphic novel.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Grimm Vol. 1: The Coins of Zakynthos is a collection of six comic book collected into one graphic novel. This is a TV Tie-In with the current NBC show Grimm. Personally, Grimm is one of my favorite shows, filling the void on television that I have been waiting for since Buffy the Vampire Slayer ended its seven-year run in 2003. This makes total sense since both David Greenwalt (co-executive produce and then executive producer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Jim Kouf (writer on the Buffy spinoff Angel), are co-executive producer of Grimm. Also, both Mark Gaffen and Kyle McVey are involved in the Grimm television show, so this is pretty well-rounded collection of creators for this graphic novel.As for the graphic novel, I quite enjoyed the story, but found some of the dialog to be off-character. The artwork is mediocre and the storyline, which is action-packed, is definitely more gruesome than the television series. The reason I say this is because beheaded noggins seem to be flying all over the place. This is not something that usually happens on the small screen. The comic also made Monroe goofier than he normal is and some of the dialog also read as just plain silly. Still, the story is about the coins we learned about in the first season of the show, and they are very dangerous. One cool thing the writers did was to introduce another Grimm, and this time she is female. And I know that she looks sexy fighting in nylons, but come on! There is no way that a Grimm would fight in sexy clothes. They fight in clothing that would help them kill the Wesen, and nylons aren't going to do that. I know that the comic industry likes to make female superheroes as sexy as possible this so boys can get all googly-eyed over the beautiful female leads, but I found this to be a little ridiculous.With a little tweaking, the comic books in this graphic novel could have been pretty awesome. I would have liked to see character that more accurately match the characters on the television series, and I would liked to see a better artist take over. I'm sure that Jose Malaga is a fine artist, but I feel that the work isn't quite detailed enough for this book. For the most part, the main characters look somewhat like they do in real life, but for me, personally, I am not a fan of this type of artwork. There wasn't ever a page of artwork that I was blown away by. Grimm Vol. 1: The Coins of Zakynthos is an exciting story and a nice addition to the Grimm universe. But the silly dialog in some parts and the so-so artwork is what caused me to only rate this comic as good. Still, I was happy to read this book, but also feel that the story should take place in and around Portland, Oregon. After all, Nick has never really left the area in the entire time the show has been on television. After all, he is a cop on a cop's salary. Flying to Europe and traveling all over the place is fairly expensive to do. Even will all of this, would I recommend this book to anyone that watches the show? You bet I would. And I also hope that Dynamite Entertainment creates some more comics for the Grimm series. If so, I will be sure to read them.I rated this book a 7 out of 10.\n", u"\n           \n           Like most people, I'm usually pretty skeptical about media tie ins, since most of the time, they're poorly rendered fanfic. Overall, this wasn't too bad.For the volume cover, they went with a photo and doctored it up nicely, just in case the casual comic book shop customer hadn't a clue that Grimm was a TV show. It's a lovely cover though, and happy that it features Nick's police partner, Hank. From the cover gallery at the end of this volume, there were a couple other good images they could've used, but of the 'photo exclusive' this one was the best.The art overall, isn't too bad, having seen much worse in other publisher franchise adaptations, but I agree with another reviewer that Nick looks pretty generic, which is a shame as David Giuntoli is pretty sexy for a comic book character.I would say the series is set between season two and three, if we were to stick it with canon, even if in the beginning of season three once Nick's back to himself, in a way, he's in search of his mother. So there are some minor spoilery stuff, if you're new to the show. They do a decent job of 'reintroducing' most of the Grimm world for people who haven't watched recently or haven't watched at all, so I don't think there'd be any confusion for those who'd never seen an episode.It starts off typical to the shows, with a seemingly normal event turned to GRIMMsome murder, and soon Nick and Hank are on the scene. It is a great parallel and foreshadow, in ways, to the upcoming wedding of Monroe and Rosalie. What I really like, is like the show, it doesn't stick to just Nick and the Monster of the Week's viewpoints. We get some good insight to Nick's mother, and get to see her kick some more ass as a Grimm. This all leads up to the overarching plot of the volume, which are some supernatural coins that first appeared in season one, the reason why Nick's mother left at the finale. Which takes not only Nick to Europe, but he brings along Hank and Monroe, as they believe Nick's mother's in danger.I enjoyed the story overall, same dry humor we get on the show, and interesting background to the world. We even get to meet a new Grimm, a female one, and learn about how other Grimm families fared. She has a near typical tragic back story, and is obviously the 'femme fatale' for the series, giving some unnecessary and trite 'sexual tension' between her and Nick. Which bothered me enough considering she was an interesting character on her own right, and smart too. Nice little twist at the end.While it didn't lead me to wanting the next volume 'right this minute', I do plan to read it and look forward to continuing comic adventures of the GRIMM family.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'30672371', u'Medical Summary, Volume 24', u'392', u'\n5158478\nAnonymous\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous\n4.15\n1077993\n56493\n', u'2016', u'5', u'6', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Hopefully, more titles will follow as we await what fate lurks down the pike for our man Sam. Entertaining, articulate, and just a good PI story, Bad Moon Rising was a first-rate read for me. \n         ", u"\n           \n           It's 1968 in this crime novel. Sam McCain is a lawyer that moonlights as a PI to pick up some extra cash. He's called out to a hippie commune outside Black River Falls, Iowa by the leader, Richard Donovan, for a matter he couldn't talk about over the phone. Sam had represented the commune a number of times in court(the sheriff was a bigot in addition to being incompetent and just plain stupid; not mention a nemesis of Sam's).He's shown a body in the barn, a young woman, the daughter of one of the richest men in town and he knows a s**t storm will hit the commune over this one. Everyone is sure who the killer is, Neil Cameron,a young man who had fallen for the young woman, a tease among the young folk of the town, and been rebuffed. A Viet Nam vet who came back a broken man over something that happened over there.Sam doesn't believe he did it, which puts him in the middle of opposing sides, as usual, as he continues to investigate the killing, and the others that come, much to the displeasure of the father, the sheriff, the folks who hate the commune(one completely nutty local radio preacher comes to mind).Author Ed Gorman writes in an engaging style and has the period details correct. I was just growing up at the time the novel was set and remember a lot of this stuff well. Even though I lived in a different part of the country, some fashions are universal. It was all familiar. which gives one a feeling of being there, just off stage, observing the action.Loved it.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Ed Gorman could have drawn on nostalgia alone when he created Sam McCain but he aimed higher. The Iowa lawyer-investigator gets caught up in the social divisions of 1950s and '60s America. This book drops us into the raging cultural battles of 1968. A local hippie commune is suspected of being responsible for the death of a young woman from a prominent family. Sam is hired to find her killer, then told by his client to drop the matter. As he digs into this mystery, he alienates large segments of town. As always, we know Sam can be counted on to find the truth no matter what. Bad Moon Rising was also enjoyable for seeing how many of the secondary characters have grown and changed over the decade from the first book. A serious girlfriend for the unlucky-at-love Sam was also welcome. If you've enjoyed previous Sam McCain stories this one will not disappoint; if not, the book is an excellent historical mystery.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Character centered story with a logical plot. Didn't guess the ending until the chapter before the end, and the resolution follows clearly from the characters. Uses Vietnam era as colorful setting that runs from cartoonish to realistic, depending on how deep Gorman goes into the character. A fun read.\n         ", u"\n           \n           3.5 Such a great fun series with interesting characters although my favorite judge just puts in a token appearance in this one. Townspeople clash with the hippies in the 60's, as do the leading imperious churchman of the town. McCain gets involved when there is a murder of a local whose body is found on the commune. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'28379472', u"Carl Weber's Kingpins: Philadelphia", u' ', u'\n147761\nBrittani Williams\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147761.Brittani_Williams\n4.30\n1872\n225\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'256', u'3.57', u'72', [(u'to-read', 141)], [u"\n           \n           SPOILER.. So my previous question was answered, Desire didn't know Dontay was connected to the man who killed her brother, and I can only assume she aborted her baby.

I\'m talking EPIC proportion let down.  First of all, I am shocked at all the positive reviews I\'m seeing. I feel like we didn\'t read the same book. A Discovery of Witches was one of my favorite reads of 2011. I wasn\'t as much into reading then, and I stumbled across this one while randomly perusing my library for books. I fell in love with the story, the characters, and the magic of it all. I felt like the story was building up for something important, something powerful. The second book was also pretty successful for me. It was lovely in the way that I find historical fiction is pleasurable. I also have a deep love of time-travel books, so I was practically guaranteed to fall head over heels. A lot of time has passed since the second, and my expectations were sky high for the third. Unfortunately, the careful world-building fell to crap in the final installment. I\'ll try to break down my main issues with the story without giving away any spoilers.1) The POV switches: I have very specific opinions about lots of POVs in the a story: Namely, I hate them. This book had at least 5 different points of view, which irritated me to no end. Why not just two? Those extra points of view just seemed lazy to me, just a way for the author to do some "telling" and less "showing" about the characters. To make matters worse, the author switched from 1st to 3rd person throughout the book! Talk about a headache. It was a terrible choice, in my opinion. 2) The number of characters: This book was like a who\'s who from the previous two books. I swear, no one was left out. There were so many people re-introduced that I had a hard time keeping track of everyone. The story felt so... cluttered. All of these extra people and their minor storylines weighed the plot down so much. It became sort of jumbled and confusing. I\'m not sure why the author didn\'t just keep her focus on the main characters.3) The lack of secrecy: I\'m so confused! In the previous books, Diana and Matthew guarded the secret of their relationship, the quest for the book, and the secrets of Matthew\'s family fiercely. In this book? They let it alllll hang out. They tell everyone EVERYTHING! Everyone seems to know what they are searching for, that Diana is pregnant, simply everything! I have no idea why this had them throwing caution to the wind. They freaking told an entire class of students what they were researching. It was madness. Then they are looking for the person "leaking their secrets"... it could be the pizza boy for all they know! It was truly bizarre.4) Diana\'s familiar: I won\'t say too much about this topic so I don\'t give away any spoilers, but I was utterly confused about the change in the firedrake\'s personality throughout the story, especially towards the end. 5) The haphazard plot: It honestly felt like the author didn\'t think this trilogy through very well. It was like the author had a brilliant idea for the first book and then had no idea how to carry it through. The third book had to reveal some mind blowing things to fit with all the buildup, but instead it was a collection of jumbled tangents. The main characters jumped from location to location, doing a series of things that didn\'t really make sense. They seemed like chickens with their heads cut off. The book didn\'t seemed planned. It was almost as though the author was making it up on the fly.6) The blood rage thing: I hated this plot point. Blood rage was supposed to be this crazy thing, but some deep breathing and zen meditation seemed to snap all the characters out of it?? I was so confused as to why it was this big issue to begin with if it was that easy to control. I would have preferred it be a mindless, insane thing instead of the nuisance it was made out to be. It was a poorly fleshed out concept that could have been more powerful.7) The Book: Okay, what is the deal with that book? We never truly get answers. I still am left wondering who created it and why. If you are reading this book thinking that something wondrous will be revealed, don\'t hold your breath.8) Plot inconsistencies: There are so many plot elements that make no sense or are left dangling. I don\'t want to go into them all because I want this review to be spoiler free, but there were many instances where the book contradicts itself. All in all, this book was a huge bummer. I give it 2 stars, mainly for nostalgia because I was happy to visit with these characters again. Oh, and can Gallowglass get his own book? Pretty please?**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review** \n', u"\n           \n           I'm disappointed that so many people are refusing to read this book because it's taken so long to come out. Shit happens that pushes publication dates back. Lots of shit happens. And some of you guys are acting like it's a personal affront and the author is just trying to piss you off. You're acting like children. No wonder authors hate reviewers. The book hasn't even come out yet and you're already talking trash.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I am looking forward to this novel with much anticipation and joy. To all the naysayers and fair weather fans out there, I have a few things to say to you. 1) D.H. is a novelist. While she may blog and update frequently, she must not be treated as an on demand writer. As a reader, it is hard to wait but novelists should be regarded for what they do so well. Let's not treat our dear author as a blogger or fan fictionist.2) Waiting is part of being a reader. JK Rowling also made readers wait and Harry Potter was still a huge hit. Let's not even get into The Game of Thrones.3) Another beautiful part of being a reader is reading other books and falling in love with other characters. Let other worlds overtake you and return to All Souls in a few short months with renewed excitement.4) Re-re-re-reading is pretty awesome!After waiting and imagining all the possible endings, I finally held the Book of Life in my hands. Much to the dismay of my family, I hid myself away in plain sight and completely devoured every single page. Unlike other trilogies or series, I feel satisfied after finishing this book and do not feel like I've been left hanging or that anything was rushed. The story was well put together and completely thought through.My only criticism is that there are so many characters I want to know more about. They were left just on the surface, were mentioned too quickly, and disappeared just as fast. So many things make up for this and as I already mentioned, I feel satisfied and I can't wait to read this series again and again.\n         ", u"\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           While I enjoyed this book, I felt it was very disjointed. I mean, don't get me wrong, I got into it, but I felt bothered by her lackadaisical approach to resolving the basic plot points of the world she created. Much like the last novel, I felt like the characters went and did things without rhyme or reason, often inexplicably ignoring the things they should do, to go and drink wine somewhere else. After more than 1500 pages, I felt like she didn't invest much in the climax either-which really, given everything the characters have gone through, wasn't much a climax at all.*****Major Spoilers Ahead********* Let's talk about the following:1. What was up with the fireplace and the tree? And the heart?1.5 Who was feeding information on their whereabouts to the Covenant people?2. Gallowglass Love Triangle-I thought for sure she was going to set him up with the vampire witch lady-but really, after watching her his entire life, he's going to leave her alone without Matthew? And he's going to miss the twins baptism? 3. Does Diana still have a tree trunk growing out of her neck? Do her eyes still flash numbers-cause that's going to be inconvenient for her as an academic.4. Who made the book and why? 5. Uh, in the novel, the book was meant to be evil and now it's not? Dude, it's made of people. Creepy. Does that mean an evil thing is living inside of her? 6. If familiars are meant to be set free and go to the place where they wait for their people-why did Goody Alden or whoever keep her shadow? 7. What happens to the book of life when Diana dies?8. When does she go back and visit Phillipe?9. Instead of focusing on saving the witch Ben was raping and torturing, why did they go and hang out at Yale?10. Blood Rage? Treatment? If so, what was the point of going to Yale?11. Didn't Diana already say she wasn't going back to her academe life? I mean, doesn't the most powerful witch of her age have stuff to do?12. Why are she and Matthew so special when they are other vampire/witch creatures?I don't know the answers to these questions.\n", u"\n           \n           I guess the good news about Deborah Harkness\u2019s The Book of Life is I didn\u2019t throw it across the room in disgust. I couldn't\u2014it's too damn dumb to make me angry. Mostly I shook my head in bewilderment at the overwhelming idiocy. This last book in the trilogy is pretty much the same as the first two: excessive details, wandering plot lines, horrible pacing, paper-thin characters, and fang-less boring vampires. When I finished reading all 561 pages, I thought: what the fuck. How can something this awful be a bestseller? But now I've at least satisfied my curiosity about how Harkness wrapped everything up (not satisfactorily), so let the shredding begin. The Book of Life begins where Shadow of Night ends. Matthew the vampire and Diana the witch return to Sept-Tours, the de Clermont ancestral home. She is pregnant with twins and they are married, two facts they would like to keep from the Congregation. Aunt Emily is dead and even though we (the readers) learned of her death in the previous book, Harkness didn\u2019t explain what happened until now. Emily supposedly died of a heart attack when two other witches were questioning her about spells she was casting. Matthew and Diana don\u2019t believe this and vow to discover the truth. They also have to deal with Matthew\u2019s blood rage, find missing pages torn from the Ashmole 782 manuscript (aka The Book of Life) in order to retrieve the whole manuscript from the Bodleian Library, confront the Congregation and stop Benjamin, Matthew\u2019s very bad son, from doing more very bad things. Many\u2014way too many\u2014things happen in this book. In order to keep this review under a million words, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights of Things That Made Me Roll My Eyes. First, however, I\u2019ll start with what I liked. It\u2019s a very short list: 1) Continuity. Considering how stuffed all these books are with details about everything, Harkness does an amazing job of connecting actions, people, and places from the last two books with this one. In chapter three, Diana is surprised to find a book she used in the 16th century to practice her handwriting still around in modern day Sept-Tours. I laughed because I remember that scene well from the second book only because it was so damn boring\u2014a very long passage describing her efforts to write the 16th century way. I thought that scene was stupid in the second book and I think it\u2019s stupid to bring it up in the third book, but wow\u2014gold star for continuity. 2) The Bishop family house. The house is the best character in the books and I am disappointed it makes only a brief appearance in this book. For a short while, Matthew and Diana and their band of merry followers stay at the house. It\u2019s playing Fleedwood Mac records nonstop. Even though I don\u2019t like any of these vampires or witches, they have my sympathy here. Fleetwood Mac sucks. 3) Harkness\u2019s writing seems to have improved between books two and three. While I still find this book deplorable, it actually keeps my attention. That\u2019s fairly amazing considering how dumb and scatterbrained it is. Oh, and the artwork for the book cover is pretty. There\u2019s that.Now I can bitch. There are too many unnecessary details. About everything. We have specific descriptions of the characters\u2019 voices; Fernando (who is a gay vampire but Harkness has so little imagination his character is stereotypically gay down to his fussiness and talented cooking) has a voice \u201cas warm and cultured as sherry aged in oak barrels\u201d (6). We know what all the characters smell like. In chapter 7, there\u2019s a detailed list of all the kitchen appliances and their uses. Diana also goes grocery shopping and meets up with some fellow witches. The whole scene is unnecessary, but it's this sentence that makes me crazy: \u201cI fumbled and nearly dropped the paper bag of apples grown on a nearby farm\u201d (105). It\u2019s the \u201cgrown on a nearby farm\u201d that makes me incoherent with rage. Who gives a shit? Is it really that important to know that Diana, as well as being so awesome in every other aspect, is also concerned about buying local produce? WHAT THE FUCK, EDITOR. Idiotic shit like this is why the book is so damn long. There are many pages devoted to the scientific analysis of Matthew\u2019s DNA, Diana\u2019s DNA, the DNA of one of the Ashmole pages\u2026who cares? Very little of it is actually relevant to the plot (whatever the hell the plot is). One of the dumbest parts of the book is the trip to the Bodleian library to steal the Ashmole manuscript. The whole heist is asinine. I\u2019m already annoyed by this sentence: \u201cIt was every library patron\u2019s nightmare\u2014that you were secretly being observed whenever you took a forbidden cough drop out of your pocket\u201d (458). As a staff person at a library and a library patron, I wonder: what the fuck is she talking about? Shove a million cough drops into your mouth\u2014we don\u2019t care. However, we do care about sugary, sticky drinks and gooey, greasy pizza. But no one should care because cough drops have nothing to do with the heist. Diana and her helpers (it takes three witches, two vampires and one firedrake to steal this damn manuscript) go to the Bodleian Library. After deactivating all the magical surveillance by using magic, Diana puts a halt to their illegal activities to call her sweetie pie. Getting this manuscript is supposedly the most important mission they have, but dumb ass has to call pookie-kins to let him know she\u2019s okay. Major fucking eye roll here. Not only that, but if their souls are so magically in sync, shouldn\u2019t he just know she\u2019s fine? Whatever. Now, even though the library is closed because of the Christmas holidays and they know that the pneumatic tube book request system is shut down, Diana and her crew of morons decide to fill out a book slip requesting the Ashmole manuscript and send it via tube. Now, I\u2019m guessing that if you\u2019re going to steal a book from a library, you don\u2019t fucking submit a written request for that actual book. That\u2019s like handing the bank teller your ATM card and then saying, \u201cThis is a stick-up. Give me money.\u201d Wtf, Diana. But this isn\u2019t the best (or worst) part. The dumb fucks stand around waiting for two hours! for the damn manuscript to appear in front of them. What the fuck! Wtf???? That makes no sense. Why the hell would you have your characters do that, Harkness? What the hell is the point of that? Do you not understand pacing? So your characters stand around for two hours doing what? Playing hopscotch? Magical orgy? What? Finally, they decide the library is not going to send them the manuscript so Diana says, oh yeah, I\u2019m a witch. Time to do magical shit. (If you\u2019re a witch, wouldn\u2019t starting with magical shit be your first move?) Eventually she does some magical shit and with the help of Corra, her unfortunately-named firedrake, she finds the fucking manuscript. During all of this, the five jackasses are joking around and giggling. That\u2019s one of the weirder aspects of this book\u2014everything is supposed to be all so dramatic and serious, but then Harkness sticks in these loony scenes with the characters tee-heeing and yee-hawing about the stupidest shit. (Also, in chapter five, the vampires greet each other with waves and cheerful calls of \u201cHi!\u201d I want to stake them all.) It\u2019s another  moment of bemusement at how weirdly out of place these scenes are; not only that, but the humor is not funny. What is funny is all the secrets that aren\u2019t secrets. Humans aren\u2019t supposed to know about daemons, witches and vampires. They know. Even if they didn\u2019t know, Matthew and Diana are the worst fucking blabber mouths around. They are constantly telling people: oh yeah, I\u2019m a vampire/witch. What\u2019s even more amusing is that as soon as one of them blabs, the human shrugs and says, effectively, \u201cSo what?\u201d When Chris, Diana\u2019s human colleague from her university, shows up, she calmly informs him that her husband is a vampire\u2014that\u2019s why he has such great hearing. Chris\u2019s only argument that Matthew can\u2019t be a vampire is because on the tv show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, girls who have sex with vampires never get \u201cknocked up,\u201d but Diana is pregnant. This dubious logic is followed by Chris stating the reason he is so calm about hearing this is \u201cI\u2019m a scientist. I\u2019m trained to suspend disbelief and remain open-minded until something is disproved\u201d (162). Yeah, I don\u2019t think Chris (or Harkness) has even the most basic understanding of scientific thinking. If his statement were correct, we\u2019d still be back in the Dark Ages. If he really were a scientist, he\u2019d ask her what proof she has that Matthew is a vampire (and that she\u2019s not nuts). There\u2019s a great (in a bad way) scene in which Matthew outs not only himself, but all supernatural creatures, to his Yale research students. They are working on his DNA analysis. There are a lot of lame jokes (students theorize that the DNA belongs to aliens and two of the students\u2019 nicknames are \u201cMulder\u201d and \u201cScully\u201d\u2014oh, tee hee, Harkness. Stop now before I wet myself) but finally Matthew says: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a vampire. And before you ask, I can go outside during the day and my hair won\u2019t catch fire in the sunlight. I\u2019m Catholic and have a crucifix. When I sleep, which is not often, I prefer a bed to a coffin. If you try to stake me, the wood will likely splinter before it enters my skin. No fangs either. And one last thing: I do not, nor have I ever, sparkled\u201d (196). The students\u2019 reaction: \u201cWhoa, dude. How old are you? Over 1,500 years! Awesome, dude! High-five!\u201d None of these so-called scientists says, \u201cUm, yeah, right. Call campus security.\u201d No one in the book (humans) ever responds with skepticism or laughter when told about these supernatural beings. Why is that? Well, Harkness does write stupid books about stupid people, but also: almost everyone in the book is a fucking supernatural being! I can think of only three humans in the book. That\u2019s it. So\u2026what\u2019s the secret? Diana and Matthew also blab about their marriage (relations between supernatural creatures is forbidden by the Congregation) and her pregnancy (forbidden). When the Congregation sends them a note saying, hey, naughty naughty, you two are married and produced children, the two dumb fucks can't figure it out: \u201cHow\u2019d they know? Who told the Congregation?\u201d Um\u2026everyone knows. You two are the Brangelina of this idiot trilogy. Same thing with Benji, Matthew\u2019s evil son. He was erased from the family tree and was supposed to be a deep, dark secret\u2026guess what? Everyone fucking knows. The Marty Stu/Mary Sue factor. Diana and Matthew are too perfect to be believable. Diana is the Best Witch Ever. She is the Most Beautiful Woman Ever. Everyone Loves Her (even Gallowglass reveals that his love for \u201cauntie\u201d is of the carnal variety). Everyone wants to help her. In one scene, we learn that Diana\u2019s awesome witch skills of the 16th century so inspired the London witches that they created a sort of shrine to her and she is now a legend. It\u2019s ridiculous. The same is true for Matthew. He\u2019s a very accomplished vampire. Granted, he\u2019s over a thousand years old, but c\u2019mon. This is the list Diana compiles: scientist, warrior, spy, prince, assassin. The list doesn\u2019t include his musical talent and woodworking skills. And, according to the last book, he's also an architect. He\u2019s even so awesome that he can master his blood rage. This awesomeness extends to vampires in general and to the de Clermont family in particular. They are the oldest, the most impressive, the most influential\u2026yes, they are the best fucking vampires ever. We get it. And when you have the best fucking vampire ever joining forces with the best fucking witch ever, you\u2019ve immediately lost any kind of tension or suspense in the story. There\u2019s very little doubt as to the outcome. Will the Dynamic Duo (along with their adoring entourage) triumph over all the obstacles in their path? Of course. They can\u2019t fail. They\u2019re too perfect. And the obstacles aren't all that difficult.What\u2019s also perfect is their passionate marital bond. Take notice, all married people: Diana and Matthew are the perfect soulmates. We are repeatedly hammered over the head with the message that yes, they really do love each other. These are a few quotes that grossed me out the most: Page 15: (after hearing of Emily\u2019s death): \u201cGallowglass left Matthew and Diana twined together in an unbreakable knot, their faces twisted with pain and sorrow, each giving the other the comfort they could not find for themselves.\u201dPage 30: \u201cHere, within the circle of his arms, was all that he had ever wanted. A wife. Children. A family of his own.\u201d (A secure job in the family business. Two weeks of paid vacation every year. A lovely home with a white picket fence and one cat, one dog, and a fire drake. Awww. Such sweet, sweet dreams\u2026for a vampire.)Page 118: \u201cHis wife\u2014his heart, his mate, his life\u2014stepped down off the porch and into his arms. Diana\u2019s eyes were the blue and gold of a summer sky, and Matthew wanted nothing more than to fall headlong into their bright depths, not to lose himself but to be found.\u201d Yes, we get it. Rainbows and unicorns and hearts full of love. Of course, since he\u2019s a vamp and she\u2019s a witch, she\u2019s going to age. He won\u2019t. Will their passion still burn so brightly when she\u2019s 60 and wrinkled? Or will he make her a vamp so he has centuries to be possessive and creepy? Whatever their future holds, I\u2019m sure it will be perfect and shiny.This is a fucked-up mess of a book. Viking, the publisher, apparently does not employ editors. All the other crap aside, it\u2019s basically a dressed-up romance novel. A very conservative romance novel. The supernatural creatures aren\u2019t very supernatural. The vampires are stripped of nearly everything that makes a vampire\u2014and stripped of everything that makes them scary. They are fang-less on many levels. Matthew is a pious Catholic who says things like, \u201cI leave that in the hands of God.\u201d He drinks wine, eats food, and wears a cross. He\u2019s about as scary as a paper cut. These vampires also breathe and have hearts that beats and circulate blood\u2014so why does Diana constantly refer to Matthew\u2019s cold body? Matthew is a fine, upstanding man who just wants a family and to be the CEO of his own dynasty. Diana is a powerful witch, but she\u2019s reluctant to use her powers, even for good. She gladly submits to her husband because that\u2019s what good little wives do. They didn\u2019t even have sex until after their marriage (which very properly produced children). This novel is full of happy domestic scenes. Chapter 33 is all about Christmas. It\u2019s so delightful: \u201cThe babies\u2019 first Christmas was as loving and festive as anyone could wish\u201d (449). Oh, goody. It\u2019s as if Harkness is starting a new genre: The \u201cCozy\u201d Vampire: He Just Wants To Be Loved. Where\u2019s Buffy when you need her?PS:No mention of the stretchy black pants! I was so disappointed. Diana's pregnant with twins. Isn't this the perfect time for stretchy black pants? Matthew gets Diana a six-slice toaster for Christmas. Holy shit. Yup, that's what she wanted and boy was she excited to get it. She used her oh-so-powerful magical skills to turn six (yes, only 6) strands of his hair gray. He's delighted and shows everyone at the big family vampire Christmas gathering. OMG. Could they be any more lame?ALERT: All Souls Trilogy lovers and haters--BBC is adapting these shitty books for tv. I pity the screenwriter whose job it is to pull a half-way intelligent story from these books. Will I watch it when it airs? Oh, hell yeah.NEW COMMENT: I have now visited and toured the Bodleian Library of Oxford (as of October 2017). Now that I've been inside (it's not just one big library as I thought), I want to reread parts of the books that deal with the library. I learned that the pneumatic tube note system has been discontinued for quite some time, so if Diana was sending a request via it, it never would have gone anywhere. Personally, I think she was too dumb to study at Oxford and be allowed to use the library.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'20503974', u'T\xe2y Nguy\xean', u'254', u'\n7756082\nHo\xe0ng V\u0103n Huy\u1ec1n\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7756082.Ho_ng_V_n_Huy_n\n1.50\n2\n0\n', u'1980', u'', u'', u'NXB V\u0103n H\xf3a', u'', u'4', u'1.50', u'2', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29424700', u'Az \xe9jszaka titka', u'524', u'\n6926240\nDean R.

He focuses on the two dominant, ostensibly allied peace negotiators, John Jay and Vergennes.Veteran diplomat and diplomatic history author Frank Brecher follows the chronology of the American War of Independence, alternating between accounts of the conflict as experienced diplomatically and, in less detail, militarily by the Americans and the French, respectively. In doing so, after summarizing in his preface a highly informed and articulate contemporary analysis of the origins of the Revolution from the perspective of the more conservative elements of the American leadership, of whom John Jay was very much a part, Brecher focuses on the particular experiences of Jay and Vergennes, both in their personal lives and in their politial careers. He describes and compares their respectiveand quite differentpreparations for their historical activities as peace negotiators, and describes the major developments of the conflict itself as they themselves participated in, and analyzed, them.While Vergennes, the French Foreign Minister, for the first time in his career, remained physically stationary in Versailles, Jay, for the first time in his life as well as career, left the New York region to live in Philadelphia, then Madrid, and finally Paris, before returning as Secretary for Foreign Affairs in 1784, after four and a half eventful and personally dramatic years abroad. The lessons each of these two diplomats learned as a result of the crucible through which they had to pass before their very personaland historically importantencounter in France toward war's end very much affected the negotiating strategies they adopted and the ultimatley paradoxical mixture of both triumph and disappoinment with which they helped bring to a succesful conclusion the military phase of an alliance embarked upon by their two nations some five long years earlier. Brecher presents a provocative view of early American diplomacy that will be of interest to scholars and students alike.", u'3', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'17906205', u'Die gro\xdfe Pflanzen-Enzyklop\xe4die von A - Z.: \xdcber 15500 Garten- und Zimmerpflanzen', u'1136', u'\n168561\nRoyal Horticultural Society\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336243537p5/168561.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336243537p2/168561.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/168561.Royal_Horticultural_Society\n4.11\n701\n50\n', u'2010', u'9', u'29', u'Dorling Kindersley Verlag', u'F\xfcr jeden Gartenfreund unverzichtbar: Das einzigartige Standardwerk pr\xe4sentiert die ganze Welt der Gartenpflanzen in einer hochwertigen, zweib\xe4ndigen Enzyklop\xe4die. \xdcber 6.000 brillante Farbfotografien und alle Informationen zu Pflegeanleitungen, Standorttipps, Krankheiten, Vermehrungstechniken, Herkunft, Arten und Sorten.

Valerie and Nick have ironed out their relationship and are in place where both are at the edge of stepping into the final commitment arena of proposing for Nick and contemplating children for Valerie. Valerie is a homicide detective in San Francisco PD, she gets the call about a murder where a note specifically for her has been left. It threatens that the murders will continue unless Katherine Glass is freed from prison. In 2009, Katherine, a beautiful and ruthless killer, was convicted of the rape, torture and murder of 6 women. The evidence was incontrovertible with video recordings of her and her masked male co-conspirator carrying out the gruesome and depraved acts. Valerie caught Katherine and ensured she went to prison with no hope of ever being released.A reluctant Valerie is forced to renew her strained and tense sparring with the sociopath that is Katherine. Katherine's former partner in crime gives hints and clues that can only be solved by Katherine. So begins the fraught and strangely compelling game of cat and mouse which Valerie is drawn into as they explore the psyche of each other, and in the process get up close and intimate. This is not without cost as Valerie begins to enter Katherine's mind games that mess with her head. With further deaths, matters come too close for comfort to Valerie's family and personal life. The man they are hunting is extremely wealthy, a master of disguise, ruthless, and determined. Can Valerie trust Katherine? She is not certain. However, she has no choice but to put her faith in her, as those closest to her find themselves in desperate danger. This is a well written and beautifully plotted story that is compelling. There is tension and suspense throughout, The central focus of the novel is the relationship between the insidiously charming, bright and twisted Katherine and Valerie, drawn to Katherine as a moth to light, in search of answers to the deepest questions in life. This is where the author's talent lies, in creating such larger than life characters and authentically delineating the manoevres between two strong women coming from opposing moral standpoints. The flaw in the novel is that Katherine's amoral partner is criminally transparent to the reader. However, I will mostly forgive this weakness, given the strengths in the narrative outlined earlier. Thanks to Orion for an ARC.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Can I get a hallelujer, Lort?!I\'m not the religious type, but give me a book like this and I suddenly start worshiping the Gods of Literature. You know - Stephen King, Agatha Christie and J.K. Rowling. Six years ago Katherine Glass abducted, heinously tortured and killed young women all over San Francisco...until Det. Valerie Hart caught her and put her away for life. *cue the sound of prison gates slamming shut*...But Katherine didn\'t commit her crimes alone, and her partner - The Masked Man - who is probably even more deranged than Katherine, was never caught. Now, the murders have started again, and left with each body is an envelope, addressed to Valerie, containing complicated clues and ciphers that will point the police to the next victim. Figure out the puzzle fast enough, save a life. But only Katherine Glass has the personal insight to decode the Masked Man\'s clues, forcing Valerie to work with a killer. Katherine promises she only wants to help - she\'s never forgiven the Masked Man for leaving her high and dry. She just wants time out of her cell, maybe some mental stimulation. But can Katherine really be trusted? (I mean, obviously the answer is "probably not", but let\'s just go with it.)LoveMurder has a very Hannibal Lecter/Clarice Starling feel to it, which is probably every serial-killer-thriller fan\'s favourite thing ever...Amiright?!I lovedddd the first book in this series, and was fangirlingly excited when I saw a second novel was coming. I\'ve been in line at my library for this for-fucking-ever, it seems like. And by the time I finally got my too-small-for-my-body hands on it I was overcome with dread. What if I had been too excited, building myself up only to be let down when this didn\'t live up to the anticipation I\'d been cultivating for months?! We\'ve all been there. #BookwormProblemsThankfully, I wasn\'t disappointed. I binge-read this in 24 hours. I just could not put it down, literally. I may have called in sick to work. Possibly. Maybe. Kind of.Valerie is a beast of a female-lead, not as damaged as she was in The Killing Lessons, but still rough around the edges with a spine of steel. The killer(s) and their crimes (both past and present) were disgusting and depraved. There\'s sex and passion in all it\'s forms. The twists and clever moments abound, resulting in some big, jaw dropping events, and some smaller, smirk inducing moments that give you the warm fuzzies. Add in the action-packed scenes and realistic procedural work and this book was literally right up my dark and twisted alley. I love, LOVE, lurve Black\'s writing style - it\'s crisp, clean, realistic, but edgy and dark. Though, I won\'t lie, there were moments where I thought "too much detail, dude, pull it back." There is the perfect mix of professional with personal, as Katherine got into Valerie\'s head and we got to experience more of Valerie and Nick\'s relationship in full swing. Really this novel just had so much depth, in terms of emotions. My only complaint is that I knew who The Masked Man was, like literally almost immediately. His role in the novel is just so...obvious, that it felt amateurish in terms of plotting. So that knocked a star off. Other than that...PRAISE BE!PS. As an aside for the more sensitive readers among us, this novel is definitely gory and startling in it\'s descriptions of the crimes, that even I, who literally loves being disgusted, was a bit squeamish a couple of times. It\'s also jam packed with oral sex and vivid descriptions of other adult things...so if that kind of writing bothers you, I\'d suggest you look elsewhere.But it worked for me!\n', u"\n           \n           A couple of years ago, I really enjoyed The Killing Lessons, a serial killer thriller, which featured Valerie Hart, a homicide detective. I was a bit surprised to see Valerie is back. For me, The Killing Lessons wasn't all that much about Valerie, who was your fairly standard broken detective then. However, in Lovemurder, she really takes center stage. Her life has changed for the better making her a different person to the one we met in the first book. Even if you haven't yet read The Killing Lessons, Lovemurder works perfectly well as a standalone serial killer thriller. The highlight for me was the relationship between Valerie and Katherine Glass, the beautiful, intelligent and mysterious serial killer who has been residing in prison since 2009, caught by Valerie and her team. I couldn't help but think of Chelsea Cains' Gretchen Lowell. Definite similarities.Katherine's partner in crime has never been caught, and now it seems he's back. A small disappointment for me was the fact that I identified Katherine's partner pretty early on. Nevertheless, there was plenty of suspense and while it wasn't quite as dark and disturbing or as strong as the first book, it was still a very enjoyable thriller. I received an ARC via NetGalley.\n         ", u"\n           \n           This is the 2nd book to feature Valarie Hart.Some years ago, Katherine Glass was sent to prison for torturing and murdering 6 women.

This time it's more personal as the clues seem to be aimed at Valarie.This is a fast paced, violent but well written novel.I would like to thank NetGalley, Orion Publishing Group and the author Saul Black for my ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I was a bit of a fan of the first book in this series \u2013 The Killing Lessons \u2013 at that point I didn\u2019t realise that there would be a second book featuring Valerie Hart but hey, here we are and genuinely, I was utterly enthralled again.See I like a good serial killer thriller me.

There are exceptions \u2013 one of which I\u2019ll be telling you about in another 2017 Ones to Watch very soon \u2013 but for now we have Saul Black. Who is writing them terribly well. Both terrifying and intriguing, LoveMurder is a bit of a roller coaster ride.We have some murders and some clues and Valerie is once again on the knifes edge of reason as she attempts to sort it all out. Her relationship with Nick is developed, you have some character arc stuff going on which is ALL great, well plotted, incredibly addictive and beautifully (horrifically beautifully at times) written.But for me the heart of this novel and where it fascinated me the most was in the relationship drawn between Valerie and the enigmatic Katherine Glass \u2013 a killer like no other and a character that just lights up the page. When these two are in a scene together you hold your breath \u2013 its almost like watching it unfold in front of you \u2013 there is a unique vibe to those portions of LoveMurder that is like a holding pattern, a short sharp moment in time before you are off to the races again. The rest of the plot moves in and out and around those moments in an exceptionally compelling way. To my mind very clever writing.The rest of the story is just as good just with a different sense and the mystery element is intelligently drawn without being convoluted or unlikely. There are plenty of edge of the seat moments, especially as you head into the final chapters, Saul Black in this case has written a wonderfully engaging and often heart pounding thriller with a touch of class. Or Glass. Yes had to be done\u2026Highly Recommended.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'29177197', u'The Toilers of the Sea, Volume 1', u'324', u'\n13661\nVictor Hugo\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415946858p5/13661.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415946858p2/13661.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13661.Victor_Hugo\n4.11\n776127\n20669\n', u'2015', u'11', u'15', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

We can not expect to help her effectually until we first understand her history and institutions her people and their aspirations. What, then, does the history of Mexico teach us? What is the meaning of the series of revolutions which have been going on in that country for the last hundred years? In other words, what have the Mexicans accomplished, and what do they now want? These revolutions, including this last long one, have all, at bottom, been phases of a blind, misguided struggle of a strong, ignorant people for liberty. They have sprung from a desire of the common people to realize the benefits of democracy. They have been a struggle against a feudal system approaching slavery. They were chiefly, although not entirely, the strivings of an oppressed people to win for themselves and their children a small place upon the soil of their native land. <br />These blind efforts have failed of their ends largely because the people have been without learning and without true leaders. There has never been a middle class in Mexico to supply leaders for the people in their struggles with the feudal lords. Organized public opinion is the only basis for democratic government, and this has never existed in Mexico. The only newspapers are controlled by the Government, by the landlords, or by the big corporations. There are no real political parties. The only politics are wholly personal, and the only political organizations are gangs formed to advance the interests of leaders whose names they bear. There are no political campaigns to educate the voters, but only processions and rallies intended to impress them. There is, in fact, no free political discussion of any kind. Elections in Mexico, consequently, are either farces or frauds. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Al punto che, oggi, la figura dell\u2019intellettuale risulta persino difficile da definire. Chi \xe8 l\u2019intellettuale?

First published in 1929, the essay was based on a series of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College, two women\'s colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928. While this extended essay in fact employs a fictional narrator and narrative to explore women both as writers of and characters in fiction, the manuscript for the delivery of the series of lectures, titled "Women and Fiction," and hence the essay, are considered non-fiction. The essay is generally seen as a feminist text, and is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.', u'174741', u'4.10', u'75000', [(u'to-read', 8057), (u'classics', 2570), (u'non-fiction', 2221), (u'feminism', 1575), (u'favorites', 1264), (u'currently-reading', 953), (u'nonfiction', 778), (u'essays', 719), (u'fiction', 502), (u'books-i-own', 368), (u'owned', 336), (u'classic', 318), (u'philosophy', 268), (u'writing', 263), (u'literature', 254), (u'feminist', 250), (u'women', 201), (u'favourites', 189), (u'20th-century', 169), (u'british', 164), (u'rory-gilmore-reading-challenge', 155), (u'essay', 154), (u'to-buy', 132), (u'owned-books', 130), (u'english', 125), (u'british-literature', 124), (u'gender', 106), (u'school', 102), (u'virginia-woolf', 99), (u'rory-gilmore-challenge', 88), (u'english-literature', 80), (u'feminismo', 76), (u'kindle', 76), (u'gender-studies', 74), (u'classics-to-read', 73), (u'rory-gilmore', 72), (u'read-in-2016', 71), (u'library', 70), (u'female-authors', 69), (u'classic-literature', 65), (u'modernism', 64), (u'modern-classics', 63), (u'england', 62), (u'wish-list', 61), (u'read-in-2017', 60), (u'my-library', 60), (u'on-writing', 60), (u'women-writers', 59), (u'college', 59), (u'female-author', 58), (u'memoir', 56), (u'adult', 54), (u'rory-gilmore-reading-list', 53), (u'history', 53), (u'gilmore-girls', 52), (u'literary-criticism', 52), (u'read-for-school', 51), (u'to-read-classics', 50), (u'ebook', 50), (u'criticism', 50)], [u'\n           \n           Every woman should read this. Yes, everyone who told me that, you were absolutely right. It is a little book, but it\'s quite likely to revitalize you. How many 113 page books and/or hour long lectures (the original format of this text) can say that?This is Woolf\'s Damn The Man book. It is of course done in an overtly polite British way... until she brings up her fountain pen and stabs them right between the eyes. She manages to make this a work of Romantic sensibility, and yet modern, piercing, and vital. Woolf was asked to give a speech on "Women and fiction." She ended up with an entire philosophy on the creative spirit, though with special attention to that of women, of course. Her thesis is simply that women must have a fixed income (500 pounds a year in her time) and a room of her own with a lock on the door. It is only with independence and solitude that women will finally be free to create, after centuries of being forced to do as men please because they support them, and to work in the middle of a drawing room with a thousand practical interruptions, ten children to see to, and a sheet of blotting paper to cover the shame of wasting her time with "scribbles," (as Jane Austen did whenever someone outside the family came into the room) when there was a house to keep and a family to raise. She also shows the creative powers of women tortured and hidden through the allegory of Shakespeare\'s sister, who never had a chance to express her genius and killed herself after being defeated at every turn.Woolf takes her readers through the history of women writers, and makes sure that the reader cannot fail to see how brief it is and how limited, and why. Woolf states that all modern women should acknowledge their ancestors who fought for five minutes and a few pieces of paper to jot down lines of Jane Eyre, Middlemarch, or Pride and Prejudice. She makes sure that women know that they can reject the framework and the form down to the very sentences that are given to them by men to find their own voice. However, this voice should be, ultimately, sexless. In her view, one should be "man-womanly," or "woman-manly," to write enduring classics. She doesn\'t let women down easy, either. The end of the book points out all the advantages young women have(/had, 1929) and yet they still don\'t run countries, wars, or companies, and there\'s no excuse for that. It\'s an exhortation to not squander everything the women\'s movement fought for. I probably could have said this in a much shorter way: "Damn the patriarchy, find your own way and your own voice in life, seize the day, just DO something. How dare you waste the opportunities that so many others would have died to have."Inspiring words on any topic, I think. I think I\'ll keep this by my bedside to reach for when I feel discouraged or lazy or bitter about my future or my current situation in life.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I can\'t believe I only read this book now. I would have needed it when I was 18, and 25, and last year and yesterday!The opening sentence caught me, right away:"But, you may say, we asked you to speak about women and fiction - what has that got to do with a room of one\'s own?"I don\'t even need to read Virginia Woolf\'s justification before I exclaim:"EVERYTHING, it has EVERYTHING to do with a room of one\'s own!"Whoever loves art, literature, and the act of writing, drawing or reading knows how hard it is to keep the deep concentration necessary to achieve something of relative creative value. If you are constantly in company, then "casual interruptions", as Woolf calls them, will eventually make you give up and do something less challenging. Quiet space and time are fundamentally important, and women have been denied both over the course of history. As Woolf is a storyteller, even when she writes nonfiction, she demonstrates the creative process by evoking an afternoon on the riverbank, where she catches a thought just like a fish. A man interrupts, and the thought disappears, never to be found again. She goes on to reflect on the development of literature, and the fact that men historically have produced more works of art than women. Her question throughout the essay is: "Why is that?"As she cannot accept the idea that men are physically and mentally stronger (an explanation she hears and finds in reference literature), there must be a different reason, which she sets out to discover. She analyses the traditional gender roles and points out that men have three advantages: money, space, and education. To prove her point, she invents a brilliant sister of Shakespeare\'s, and assumes that she is equally talented. Woolf creates a storyline for her quest to conquer the literary world of the 16th century just like Shakespeare did in real life, and shows the various stages at which her access to the world are blocked. It is a harsh story, and it illustrates the difference between men\'s and women\'s opportunities perfectly.So far so good. Her lovely prose and beautiful literary examples make the argument for equality read like a novel, but I am always a bit cautious when I read political essays. There is so much attached to the question of feminism today that I dare not guess what Virginia Woolf\'s final suggestion or solution will be. I am almost nervous, as I fear I might stop loving the book when I read the conclusion. But this is where she really surprises me, and where I feel that she has written the book for me specifically. She does not end by delivering a hate speech towards men, and by proclaiming that women should take over their roles and become more like them. She rather insists that women should be given the same freedom to develop their OWN strengths:"It would be a thousand pities if women wrote like men, or lived like men, or looked like men, for if two sexes are quite inadequate, considering the vastness and variety of the world, how should we manage with one only? Ought not education to bring out and fortify the differences rather than the similarities?"This is something very close to my heart, and a reason why I struggle with the political feminism of my home country. I have never been able to accept that I must strive to be the SAME as a man, rather than to have the same basic opportunities to develop in my own way. I have never understood why we try to impose masculine ideals on women instead of creating an environment of respect for feminine strengths - and I remember being extremely angry at a pre-school for banning the doll\'s house from the playroom so that girls wouldn\'t adopt typical "girly" behaviour. I found that insulting. What about cars, then? Considered boy\'s toys, and therefore acceptable? The same goes for the pinkophobia that some parents develop to protect their girls from looking too feminine. It is a colour, just like blue? And why is it politically loaded, if blue is not? Are they not making the point that the things girls choose are less valuable?I am in deep waters now, I realise, so I will return to why Virginia Woolf is such a role model and heroine for me. She sees human beings in their multifaceted identities, and claims, rightly in my opinion, that any creative person must be able to draw from male AND female parts of the mind:"Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness. There must be freedom and there must be peace."This is by far the best essay on gender equality I have read, as it respects and values the individual wishes and needs of women (and men) and does not try to create (by force) a uniform sameness. At the same time, it is a declaration of love to literature and creativity. It is entertaining, funny and informative. It has it all! I want more Virginia Woolf!Favourite quote:"For books continue each other, in spite of our habit of judging them separately."\n         ', u'\n           \n           There are so many books that one \u2018just knows\u2019 what they are going to be about. I have always \u2018known\u2019 about this book and \u2018knew\u2019 what it would be about. Feminist rant, right? Oh, these people do so preach to the choir, don\u2019t they? Why do they hate men so much? In the end they are no different to the male chauvinists they are attacking. Why can\u2019t they just be more even handed?That none of this is the case, of course, does not matter at all, because reiterating received wisdom seems to be all that is necessary today \u2013 read 99% of the critiques of The God Delusion and the horrifying thing you will find is either a mindless acceptance or a mindless rejection of Dawkins. It is enough to fill me with near complete despair.The blurb on the back of the Penguin edition of this book says that this is \u201cone of the greatest feminist polemics of the century\u201d. There is a quote too from Hermione Lee (apparently, Woolf\u2019s greatest biographer) which reads, \u201cfierce, energetic, humourous\u201d. Look, I really loved this book and would recommend it whole-heartedly \u2013 but it is none of those things.A polemic is a strong verbal or written attack \u2013 to say this book is even an attack is really stretching the friendship. This is the most mild of books. Its central argument is that women need money of their own and a room of their own, with a lock on the door, if they want to write. How can one really be \u2018fierce\u2019 if that is all one is going to argue? She ends with a quote from a man who provides a list of the greatest poets of the last couple of hundred years (c.1900) of which Keats was the only one who was not either a university person or of independent means.So, I guess her recommendation is that if you want to write you need to be independently wealthy \u2013 something I haven\u2019t quite achieved yet. But eminently sensible advice all the same.This book is based on a series of lectures she gave to women at Cambridge Uni on Women and Fiction and it is a delight that rather then make this a polemic she actually makes this a work of fiction \u2013 creating a series of Marys who go off into the world and be idol \u2013 as this is one of the criteria necessary for writing great fiction (no matter what you genitalia are up to) and part of the reason why being wealthy helps.She also says that the best fiction is not written by men or women, but by men or women who have lost a sense that they are writing as men or women. That writing that focuses too closely on explaining past hurts \u2013 however well justified \u2013 ends up being bad writing. That fiction, when it is done properly, has a truth of its own that ought to be authentic and followed by the writer despite any agenda of the writer. This is such a lovely idea \u2013 and much more interestingly about fiction than about women. And this is as it ought to be.Some of Woolf\u2019s writing \u2013 I\u2019ve also just finish reading To the Lighthouse \u2013 feels heavy now, some of her paragraphs go for three pages and that can make reading her feel a bit of a struggle \u2013 but she writes so beautifully and has the annoying habit of making sense that it is no wonder that so many people have become so annoyed with her.In the end I think it is only possible for people to say this is a fierce book or a polemic on the basis of their views, not Virginia\u2019s. Her views on feminism expressed in the book today seem rather depressingly self-evident and expressed in a light and very careful way. But to a society that is not prepared to listen even the mildest expression of unpopular views will seem harsh, polemical and, well, just plain wrong.Not the book I suspected, infinitely better than that.\n', u'\n           \n           Words fail me as I seek to express what I think of Virginia Woolf. Or to sum up in a few measly paragraphs, a book that may just have shattered into a million pieces all my illusions about the art of writing and reshaped my whole perspective.Have you ever imagined a disembodied voice whispering into your ears, the wisdom of the ages as you flipped through the pages of a book? how often have you conjured up the vision of the writer talking to you, teaching you, humoring you and coaxing you to open your mind to newer things as you read a book? Have you felt a book stop being just a book somewhere and instead appear as a beacon of enlightenment that shines down the light of knowledge upon your darkened, ignorant soul? This is how profoundly A Room of One\'s Own affected me.I will adopt this book as my writing Bible. I will read this every time I feel dejected, sad or terribly lost. And I will read this again and again, until I can ascertain that the message, the very spirit of this fine piece of writing has been assimilated into the core of my being. Okay now that I\'ve gotten the stream of incoherent gushing out of the way, let me try and bestow on this review some semblance of real meaning.It will be irreverent of me to call A Room of One\'s Own a mere essay or something that grew out of a lecture given at Girton College, Cambridge. This is the essence of Virginia Woolf herself, captured at the peak of her glory, all within 111 pages. This is Woolf reaching out from within the confines of this book and handing out to you the precious fruits of years of her hard work - her thoughts, her research, her observations, her inferences, her views. So what if it is about the subject of women? and writing? Aren\'t women one half of the human race? The so-called better half at that. What is so wrong about getting to know about the history of their evolution as thinkers, as composers, as sentient beings with the power of expression but without the power to assert themselves?So you better read it. Yes you, the silently scoffing and judging member of the \'stronger\' sex. Yes you too. Because it does not only talk about women writers but life itself and the art of writing.The blurb and the countless reviews famously identify this book as one of the greatest feminist polemics of the last century. I beg to differ. It will be unfair to tag it with the label of a polemic - a word with a highly negative connotation. Because Virginia Woolf\'s aim, instead, was to dispel all forms of negativity from the vocation of writing. Sure, she gives us the feminist side of things - but her voice is not full of seething rage or resentment but balanced, logical, sardonic and even humorous at times.This is Woolf\'s homage to the spirit of those unsung heroines of the distant past who may have written poems, songs and ballads but were forced to adopt anonymity simply because it was unacceptable for a woman to write. Those imaginative souls who may have wanted desperately to write but could not because society thrust gender specific roles of the mother and wife on them and did not even bother educating them.What if Shakespeare had an equally talented sister but who could never be another Shakespeare herself because she would have been mocked at had she expressed a desire to write plays or poetry? Woolf asks us to spare a moment and reflect on the sad fate of these martyrs, history has not bothered to record.\n"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Bront\xeb who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to. Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without singing them, was often a woman."\nShe makes it clear to us that Jane Austen was a clever, clever writer because she never tried to adopt the style of a man\'s writing or his sentence construction. She created her own. And with a rather limited range of experiences in the real world at her command, she could neither have written about bloody wars nor about politics - spheres women still hadn\'t earned the right to enter. Instead she wrote what she saw and witnessed in the sitting chambers of the houses of the gentry. (This rekindles my interest in Jane Austen which had started to wane over the past few years.)She also repeatedly stresses on how a woman needs a room of her own and money to be able to write. A room of her own because she needs a breathing space where she could revel in the knowledge of her identity as a person, as a woman, as a thinker over her identity as a dutiful daughter or wife or mother. Although I disagree with her assertion of having money as a necessary criterion for aiming to become a writer, I think financial independence could have been a metaphor for empowerment of women or a reference to freedom from having to rely on someone else, especially a man, and to be able to decide the course of your own life.Woolf ends her essay by exhorting both men and women to take up their pens and write, laying emphasis on the necessity of stepping outside the limits of narrow gender identities and be the writer with an androgynous mind instead - the one capable of uniting the spirit of both the man and woman and letting it reflect in one\'s craft.And it is at this point, I felt truly thankful for her 500 pounds a year and a room of her own. Since that may have, after all, allowed this marvelous, deeply enlightening piece of writing to come into existence in the first place.\n         ', u"\n\nA World Of Her Own\n\u201cHere then I was (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2013 it is not a matter of importance) sitting on the banks of a river a week or two ago in fine October weather, lost in thought.\u201dAnd they all do appear, as fictional novelists. Avatars of the Gauri.Of course, I didn\u2019t know they were so, and I didn't want to find out. I knew Woolf was perfectly capable of inventing novelists and novels inside this small thought-world she was spinning.What is their purpose in this fictional essay? They serve as demonstrations. Of writers who could have been, if only certain conditions had been met. Of the many literary geniuses lost to humankind because it was so late in letting the women into literature.And what would have allowed this?Woolf examines the minimum material preconditions that would be required before genuinely self-representative literature can emerge from among the women. According to her this requires enough money, leisure and solitude -- and they should be earned (?) and should come with no attachments. Only then can women start producing literature of their own that is not defined by their relations to men. Woolf considers Austen as the best example of such a completely free feminine literature (for contrast, consider Shakespeare as a genuinely human representation of self) i.e. a true representation of the female self, untainted by anger towards the male attitudes, frustration arising from limited opportunities, fear of social repercussions, wariness of what is expected of a women, and so on.After much reflection and survey of literature and its origins, etc., Woolf comes back to the original point that material conditions are all important.This is something we can agree to. And we can share in the sense of loss that pervades this book. But we need not stop there\u2026Extending The Argument: The Productions of ExclusionWoolf\u2019s exploration is about women\u2019s literature, but I am sure we can extend the scope of the essay a bit beyond that.We should be able to go so far as to tell that the material conditions of any group more or less determines its literary output:1. A leisurely class with plenty of time and education can create and consume subtle and philosophical literature and art.2. A working class which is barely literate, does not have time for leisurely study and starved for quick entertainment will produce and consume crasser types of pop-art, barely going beyond the most cliched levels such as crude comics and perhaps the movies.3. In between, might be the service-economy middle classes who have a bit of education -- required to appreciate moderate doses of art, and can afford the time and energy for producing and consuming genre fiction, YA, etc.So each class develops its tastes and consumption habits based on its unique material conditions\u2026 That is quite Marxist of us, isn\u2019t it?Any group denied this material basis is denied of literature too, as postulated by Woolf for the feminine in her essay. And, as we have seen, each group is denied literature and art to the extent that it is denied material comforts and leisure.Thus we can extend Woolf\u2019s speculative pathos and be sad about how many varieties of literary perspectives are lost to us even today due to such exclusion\u2026As I said, in Woolf\u2019s analysis it is the women who are the victim to this unfair exclusion. But today, perhaps, in many countries women are not so materially backward anymore. That does not, of course, make Woolf\u2019s essay outdated, since it is only a way of looking at literature \u2014 both in its conditions for creation as well as consumption.In fact, I would now like not only extend Woolf\u2019s propositions, but invert them a bit \u2014 to propose that we can even apply the conditions of material repression to the men of today. Women are freer to pursue non-material careers today \u2014 the stigma has been removed and the requisite (500 pounds?) material conditions are easier to come by. Whereas men find it harder.For instance, consider how much easier it is for a woman to go into a career in humanities. For a man to do the same would be much more difficult (note that this reviewer speaks only from the limited perspective of his own social experience of the educational aspirations prevalent in a third world country).Why ?Because societal norms expects man to be the provider \u2014 hence he should not be seen going into careers which are known to be of questionable monetary value, with little or no employment prospects.This is, perhaps, especially true in a patriarchal society like what we still have in India, and probably not as much applicable in the west \u2014 I do not really know. Hopefully a few comments from varying cultural milieus will help us pin this down.All this shouldn\u2019t be taken to be only about production of literature \u2014 production is always in a tangled feed-back loop with consumption as far as arts are concerned. And the same is true for consumption too, i.e., for general reading. It is the women who seems to predominate reading in India. And as an experiment, if you would take one look at the \u2018top reviewers\u2019 listings in India, you will see that it is dominated by women too. Men are not supposed to \u201cwaste their time\u201d reading and talking about books. They have manly tasks to attend to, like selling soaps and making financial instruments.And in keeping with this, of all my friends, the ones who are trained in humanities, especially literature, philosophy, etc., predominantly tend to be women. And those men who genuinely have an interest in literature and art tend to be in a process of self-education (including me) \u2014 stumbling and searching for a sure path, with no formal training or critical education. Hence it is much harder for those men to then be able to compete with the trained women (whether in creation of literary products or of literary markets, through their reading preferences) \u2014 with more time on her hands and a room of her own too, now. It might be that the cultural world is being remade in the image of Eve, or Gauri, and perhaps it is a good thing too. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'32428150', u'DREAM BOOK - Lucid Dreaming and Dream Recall (Dream Book Trilogy 1)', u' ', u'\n471809\nCraig Hamilton-Parker\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/471809.Craig_Hamilton_Parker\n4.00\n200\n13\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'2', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'17576317', u'International Relations in Europe, 1689-1789', u'96', u'\n3153340\nJ.H.

A. MACDEVITTWITH AN INTRODUCTION BYTHOMAS DE QUINCEYOpening:THE COMMENTARIES OF CAIUS JULIUS CAESARTHE WAR IN GAULBOOK II.\u2014All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are farthest from the civilisation and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valour, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone: it is bounded by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae: it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the river Rhine, and stretches towards the north. The Belgae rise from the extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine; and look towards the north and the rising sun. Aquitania extends from the river Garonne to the Pyrenaean mountains and to that part of the ocean which is near Spain: it looks between the setting of the sun and the north star.CLAVDIA LOOKS SVCH A GVILTY PVSS\n         ", u"\n           \n           Fascinating historical document.

But the great histories and historians of World History bring us far more than events of nations, chronicles of the Rise and Fall of Civilizations, or lessons and precedents from the past; they also constitute a fundamental part of World Literature, bringing us great reading experiences and exciting sagas as in Thucydides\' "History of the Peloponesian War," in-depth portraits and readings of the character of great men and shapers of the world as in Plutarch\'s "Parallel Lives" and China\'s "Records of the Grand Historian" by Si Ma Chen, and deep philosophical and scientific insights into the workings of human society its environment as revealed in the panoramic visions of great Islamic historian Ibn Khaldun, Karl Marx, Oswald Spengler and Sir Arnold Toynbee. As such, in our modern globalized world of the 21st century, where not only our own history, but also the interrelated histories of all of nations show so clearly that "the past is always present," and therefore every educated citizen of the modern world has an obligation to read the great works of history from all major civilizations to even begin comprehending the living world about us and the ultimate meaning of our own lives.WHAT WAS THE FIRST WORK OF HISTORY IN THE WORLD?If to begin our survey we put the daunting threshold question of what was the firs work of "history" in human experience, like most radical questions we will find that the answer all depends on how we put the question and define its terms. "History" undoubtedly began with the campfire stories of Neolithic man about families, tribes and conflicts far before the invention of writing. Histories were passed down in oral sagas memorized by poets such as Homer\'s "Iliad and Odyssey," and only centuries later recorded in script. But true history begins with works of systematic analysis and interpretation of human events, and in that light the general consensus is that the first great work of World History was that of the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th Century BC, "The Histories." HERODOTUS, AUTHOR OF "THE HISTORIES"Herodotus (5th Century BC) is thus often referred to as "The Father of History," a title conferred upon him by Cicero amoung others, but also disparagingly as "The Father of Lies" by some of his critics. He was born in Halicarnassus, a Greek city which had become part of the Persian Empire that enjoyed strong trade relations with Egypt. He travelled widely, spending time in Periclian Athens, Egypt, Persia and Italy and collected histories, tales and historical lore wherever he traveled, noting the customs of the people, the major wars and state events and the religions and lore of the people. He wrote in a "folksy" style and purported to record whatever was told to him, which led to critics deploring some of the "tall tales" or mythical accounts in his work, but which Herodtodus himself said he included without judgment to their ultimate truth to illustrate the historical beliefs of the peoples he encountered. His primary focus was to explain the history and background of the Persian War between the Greeks and the Persian Empire, though he also included cultural observations of other peoples such as the Egyptians. His "Histories" is entertaining and interesting, though somewhat voluminous and scattered for the modern reader unfamiliar with the context. THUCYDIDES, MASTER OF REPORTORIAL AND EYEWITNESS HISTORYThucydides (460-395 BC) is most remembered for his epic "History of the Peloponnesian War" of Greece which recounts the struggle for supremacy and survival between the enlightened commercial empire of Athens and its reactionary opponent Sparta, which ended in the defeat of the Athenians. His approach and goal in writing was completely different from Herodotus, as he was himself a General in the wars he wrote about and set out to provide "the inside story" of eyewitnesses and personal accounts of the major participants in the great events of their history so that their characters, understanding, strategies and actions could be closely judged, especially for the purpose of educating future statesmen and leaders. This approach was later shared by Polybius in his "The Rise of the Roman Empire." As a more contemporary history it is often more exciting to read, and establishes the tradition followed by Livy and others of including the "key speeches" of the leaders in war council, the "inside story" of their schemes and motivations, and rousing tales of the ups and downs of fast-moving battles. It contains such classics such as Pericles "Funeral Speech" for the ballen war heroes reminiscent of Lincoln\'s Gettysburg address. It is a must for those seeking to understand Classical Greece and a rich and exciting read. SIMA QIAN, AND THE "RECORDS OF THE GRAND HISTORIAN" OF HAN DYNASTY CHINASima Qian (Szu Ma Chien/145-86 BC) is regarded as the greatest historian of China\'s long and florid history and his personal tragedy is also held up as an example of intellectual martyrdom and integrity in the face of power. He like his father was the chief astrologer/astronomer and historian of the Han Imperial Court under Emperor Wu. His epic history "Records of the Grand Historian" sought to summarize all of Chinese history up to his time when the Han Dynasty Empire was a rival in size and power to that of Imperial Rome. He lived and wrote about the same time as Polybius, author of "The Rise of the Roman Empire," and like him he wrote from the vantage point of a newly united empire having overcome centuries of waring strife to establish a unified and powerful domain. In style, his history has some of the character of Plutarch in his "Lives" in that it often focuses on intimate character portraits of such great men as Qin Shi Huang Di, the unifier and First Emperor of China, and many others. It also contains rich and varied accounts of topic areas such as music, folk arts, literature, economics, calendars, science and others. He was the chief formulator of the primary Chinese theory of the rise and fall of imperial dynasties known as the "Mandate of Heaven." Like the theory of the Divine Right of Kings, its premise was that Emperors and their dynasties were installed on earth by the divine will of heaven and continued so long as the rulers were morally upright and uncorrupted. However, over centuries most dynasties would suffer corruption and decline, finally resulting in Heaven choosing another more virtuous dynasty to displace them when they had forfeited the "Mandate of Heaven," a kind of "Social Contract" with the divine rather than with mankind. Then, this cycle would repeat itself over the millennia. His personal life was occasioned by tragedy due to his intellectual honesty in the "Li Ling Affair." Two Chinese generals were sent to the north to battle the fierce Xiongnu hordes against whom the Great Wall was constructed, Li Ling and the brother-in-law of the Emperor. They met disaster and their armies were annihilated, ending in the capture of both. Everyone at Court blamed the disaster on Li Ling in order to exonerate the Emperor\'s relative, but Sima Qian, out of respect for Li Ling\'s honor disagreed publicly and was predictably sentenced to death by Emperor Wu. A noble like Sima Qian could have his death sentence commuted by payment of a large fine or castration but since he was a poor scholar he could not afford the fine. Thus, in 96 BC, on his release from prison, Sima chose to endure castration and live on as a palace eunuch to fulfill his promise to his father to complete his histories, rather than commit suicide as was expected of a gentleman-scholar. As Sima Qian himself explained in his famous "Letter to Ren An:"\u201cIf even the lowest slave and scullion maid can bear to commit suicide, why should not one like myself be able to do what has to be done? But the reason I have not refused to bear these ills and have continued to live, dwelling in vileness and disgrace without taking my leave, is that I grieve that I have things in my heart which I have not been able to express fully, and I am shamed to think that after I am gone my writings will not be known to posterity. Too numerous to record are the men of ancient times who were rich and noble and whose names have yet vanished away. It is only those who were masterful and sure, the truly extraordinary men, who are still remembered. ... I too have ventured not to be modest but have entrusted myself to my useless writings. I have gathered up and brought together the old traditions of the world which were scattered and lost. I have examined the deeds and events of the past and investigated the principles behind their success and failure, their rise and decay, in one hundred and thirty chapters. I wished to examine into all that concerns heaven and man, to penetrate the changes of the past and present, completing all as the work of one family. But before I had finished my rough manuscript, I met with this calamity. It is because I regretted that it had not been completed that I submitted to the extreme penalty without rancor. When I have truly completed this work, I shall deposit it in the Famous Mountain. If it may be handed down to men who will appreciate it, and penetrate to the villages and great cities, then though I should suffer a thousand mutilations, what regret should I have?\u201d\u2014 Sima Qian JULIUS CAESAR: HISTORY AS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND AUTOMYTHOLOGYJulius Caesar was famous for writing accounts of his own military campaigns, most notably in his "History of the Gallic Wars." Curiously, he writes of himself in the third person. Though a personal history, his writing contains little introspection or deep analytical thought and is rather the action-drama of the campaign, with special care to show his own personal courage and leadership. Before the 20th century most European schoolboys would read the work as part of their efforts to learn Latin in Grammar School. Later famous leaders such as Winston Churchill also followed in Caesar\'s tradition in writing history alonside making it, for which he received the Nobel Prize. Caesar\'s work is worth reading and exciting in parts, though sometimes becoming repetitive in the minutiae of the endless conflicts. THE GREAT ROMAN HISTORIES: LIVY, POLYBIUS, TACITUS, SEUTONIUS AND AMMIANUS MARCELLINUSThe thousand-year history of the Roman Republic and Empire can be gleaned from these five great historians in the order presented. For the earliest history of the founding of the Roman Republic from the 6th-4th Centuries BC Livy (59BC-17 AD) in his "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (From the Founding of the City) is the best source, tracing the saga from the tale of Aeneas fleeing from fallen Troy to the Rape of the Sabine Women, Romulus & Remus, the tyranical Tarquin Kings, the Founding of the Republic, the evolution of the Roman Constitution and up to the sack of the city by the Gauls in the 4th Century BC. Though ancient history is presumed to be boring, I surprisingly found Livy\'s account surprisingly lively, almost a "can\'t put down read."Polybius (200-118 BC) then picks up the story in his "The Rise of the Roman Empire" tracing the three Punic Wars with Carthage, Hannibal\'s campaign over the Alps and Rome\'s entanglement with the collapsing Greek Empire of Seleucis, Macedon and the Ptolmeys until attaining supremacy over the entire Mediterranean. Polybius is a surprisingly modern historian who saw as his challenge to write a "universal history" similar to that of our age of Globalization in which previously separate national histories became united in a universal field of action with integrated causes and effects. He was a Greek who was arrested and taken to Rome and then became intimate with the highest circles of the Roman Senate and a mentor to the Scipio family of generals. He like Thucydides then attempts to tell the "inside story" of how Rome rose to universal dominance in its region, and how all the parts of his world became interconnected in their power relations. Tacitus (56-117 AD) continues the story after the fall of the Republic and rise of the Roman Empire under the emperors. Along with his contemporary Seutonius who published his "History of the Twelve Caesars" in 121 AD, he tells of the founding of the Empire under Julius Caesar, the Civil Wars of Augustus involving Mark Anthony & Cleopatra, the Augustan "Golden Age" and the descent into unbelievable corruption, degeneration, homicidal and sexual madness and excess under Caligula and Nero, followed by a return to decency under Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. The endstory of the Roman Empire is reflected in Ammianus Marcellinus (395-391 AD) who wrote in the time of Julian the Apostate who unsuccessfully tried to shake off Christianity and restore the old pagan and rationalist traditions of Classical Greece and Rome. PLUTARCH, THE GREAT HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHERPlutarch (46-120 AD) is most famous for his historical biographies in "Parallel Lives" or simply "Lives." He was, like Polybius, a Greek scholar who wished to open understanding between the Greek and Roman intellectual communities. His "Parallel Lives" consists of character portraits and life histories of matching pairs of great Greeks and great Romans such as Alexander and Caesar, hoping to enhance appreciation of the greatness of each. Much of Shakespeare\'s knowledge of the classical world reflected in his plays such as "Julius Caesar," "Anthony and Cleopatra" and "Coriolanus" came from reading Plutarch in translation. His character analyses are always insightful and engaging to read. His biographical method was also used by the great near-contemporary Sima Qian of Han Dynasty China. IBN KHALDUN, ISLAMIC PIONEER OF MODERN HISTORY, SOCIOLOGY AND ECONOMICSOne of the blind spots in our appreciation of World History is the underappreciation of the contributions of Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) and many other Islamic and non-Western thinkers, including Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn Fadhl-all\u0101h Hamad\u0101n\u012b (1247\u20131318), a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, and Ala\'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni (1226\u20131283) a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta\' r\u012bkh-i jah\u0101n-gush\u0101 (History of the World Conqueror). Of these Ibn Khaldun was the greatest and a theoretical forerunner of our modern approaches to history, far ahead of his time and little appreciated in either the Western or the Islamic world until recently. His greatest work is the The "Muqaddimah" (known as the Prolegomena) in which he anticipated some of the themes of Marx in tracing the importance of the influence of economics on history, including the conflict between the economic classes of the nomadic pastoral and herding peoples, the settled agriculturalists and the rising urban commercial class. Like Marx he stressed the importance of the "economic surplus" of the agricultural revolution and the "value-added" of manufacture, which allowed the rise of the urban, military and administrative classes and division of labor. He stressed the unity of the social system across culture, religion, economics and tradition. He even anticipated some of the themes of Darwin and evolution, tracing human progress in its First Stage of Man "from the world of the monkeys" towards civilization. Toynbee called the Muqaddimah the greatest work of genius of a single mind relative to its time and place ever produced in world history. THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE MONGOL EMPIRE"The Secret History of the Mongol Empire" was precisely that, a private history written for the family of Ghengis Khan recording its rise and expansion from Ghengis Khan\'s humble personal origin to an empire stretching from China to Poland and Egypt. Its author is unknown but it contains an engaging account of the Khanate, the royal family and its traditions and the incredible expansion of its domain. While not a theoretical work it provides a useful missing link in our understanding of the Mongol Empire as a beginning stage of modern Globalization and a conduit for sharing between civilizations, East and West, and, unfortunatelyh for the transmission of the Black Plague across the world. THE GREAT MODERNS: GIBBON, MARX, SPENGLER & TOYNBEEThe "must read" classics of modern World History include the work of Edward Gibbon "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" which traces its fall to a decline in civic virtue, decayed morals and effeminacy amoung the public and the debilitating effects of Christianity vis-a-vis the rationalism of the Greek-Roman heritage. Marx, of course is central to modern history, not only formulating the laws of social development based on economics, class conflict and the transition from agricultural to capitalist economies, but also formulating the revolutionary program of Communism. Oswald Spengler was a remarkable German amateur historian whose "Decline of the West" traced a theory of "organic civilizations" that have a birth, blossoming, limited lifespan and death like all living creatures. He held this to be a cyclical universal historical process of civilizations now exemplified by the West entering the stage of spiritual exhaustion and collaps in warfare. Arnold Toynbee charted a similar process analyzing 26 civilizaitons across all human history, but differed with Spengler in that he believed moral reform and a return to Christian ethics could revive the West and forestall its decline. SPIRITUS MUNDI AND WORLD HISTORYIn my own work, the epic contemporary and futurist novel Spiritus Mundi World History plays a central role as various characters such as Professor Riviera in the Mexico City Chapter and Prof. Verhoven of the Africa chapters discourse on human history, evolution, evolutionary biology and the rise of civilization, culminating with the quest of the protagonists led by Sartorius to establish a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly for global democracy, a globalized version of the EU Parliament as a new organ of the United Nations.

In discussing this book with my some members of my family, my husband said he read it in Latin when he was in elementary school in Greece. He said when he was young he could read and write Latin as well as he could Greek. My sister remembers reading it and having to translate it in her Latin class in high school. But I do not remember reading it. I only took Latin for one year then we moved and the next school did not teach Latin. (The problems of frequent moving as a military brat)The Commentaries is Julius Caesar\u2019s firsthand account of the Gallic Wars. It is written as a third person narrative. Caesar describes the battle and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting local armies in Gaul. What amazes me is that I am reading something written over two thousand years ago by one of histories greatest military commanders. Needless to say I am reading a translated edition but to have a book survived this long is amazing and it is still being read today. I can just picture Caesar sitting in his tent after a day of battle writing his book.Gaul is what today we know as France, Belgium and part of Switzerland. The Helvetii from Switzerland were feeling constricted in their valley so they started migrating over into what was a northern Roman province. Caesar pushed them back into their traditional land. Then King Ariovistus along with some Germanic mercenaries try to move into Italy and again Caesar ventured out to meet them and so it goes for nine years.The book is interesting in its descriptions of Gaulish customs, religion and the comparison between the Gaul and Germanic peoples. The geography descriptions I found interesting also. Overall I enjoyed the book but even after reading it I still cannot remember if I read it in elementary or high school. I read this as an audio book downloaded from Audible.

The bull market of the 1990s came to a close, ushering in the end of the dot-com boom, a record number of mergers occurred, and accounting scandals in companies like Enron and WorldCom shook the financial industry to its core. In this wide-ranging volume, financial historian Charles R. Geisst provides the first history of Wall Street, explaining how a small, concentrated pocket of lower Manhattan came to have such enormous influence in national and world affairs. In this updated edition, Geisst sums up the recent turbulence that has threatened America's financial industry. He shows how in 1997 thirty NASDAQ market-makers paid a record $1.3 billion fine for price irregulaties in stocks. He makes sense of the closing of the bull market, and explains a major change in the accounting rules for mergers that caused monumental losses for companies like AOL Time Warner. He recounts how in the aftermath of the speculative fever that swept Wall Street in the 1990s, the scandals at Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, and Conseco represent a last gasp of mergermania and a fallout from a bubble-like market. Wall Street is at once the story of the street itself, from the days when the wall was merely a defensive barricade built by Peter Stuyvesant, to the modern 'billion-dollar' computer-driven colossus of today. In a broader sense it is an engaging economic history of the United States, the role Wall Street played in making America the most powerful economy in the world, and the many challenges to that role it has faced in recent years.", u'453', u'3.80', u'138', [(u'to-read', 211)], [u'\n           \n           This book took quite a bit of effort to get through. Although I understand the importance of investing for the future, the actual specifics of stocks, bonds, securities, etc, bore the pants off me. The minutiae of brokering and trading holds no appeal to me, much to the chagrin of my wife. However, I am a history buff, and I read this book with the hope it would shed some light on a subject I know next to nothing about. I hoped to read of the great characters who made their fortunes on the Street, and in many cases lost them. I was also curious as to how Wall Street got its start, its name, and its practices. Unfortunately, Charles Geisst, a Professor of Finance in the School of Business at Manhattan College, doesn\u2019t write with much flair or sizzle. Good history books come alive and read almost like a novel. While informative, the book was rather boring and very slow. Add to that Geisst\u2019s use of investment jargon that novices (such as myself) don\u2019t understand, and the result is a ponderous, textbook-like history book. However, I did found out how Wall Street got its name. The street was originally a thoroughfare that ran beside a wall designed to protect lower Manhattan from unfriendly Indians. The original investors met in the street, outdoors, to trade and bargain. Geisst traces the history of Wall Street from 1790 through 1996, covering the major players such as William Duer, judge, member of the Continental Congress, and signer of the Articles of Confederation. After making a quick fortune in land speculation, he landed in debtor\u2019s prison, bankrupt. A close friend of Alexander Hamilton, who at one point intervened in his behalf, he was perhaps the first celebrity merchant. Duer, before his fall, moved in the most fashionable and influential circles. He was a portent of the Goulds, Cookes and Morgans yet to come. Geisst covers the so-called robber barons, Wall Street\u2019s reaction to New Deal regulations, and generally laments the lack of government oversight over Wall Street for much of its history. While he goes into great, mind-numbing detail of the inner machinations and nefarious deals, he neglects to mention how great the country was doing during this time. He leaves the impression that Wall Street is a hidden, exclusive bastion of greed and corruption, untouched by the outside world. He blames Wall Street for the Great Depression and other recessions, but gives it little credit for the unprecedented creation of wealth that has made the U.S. the richest nation in history. Shockingly, he completely ignores the rise of the investor class in recent years, some 50 million Americans who now own their own piece of the Street through 401(k)\u2019s, IRA\u2019s, etc. Despite the book\u2019s faults, and tediousness, I\u2019m glad I read it. Any Wall Street buff would enjoy it.\n         ', u'\n           \n           A great overview of how the US became what it is, in terms of finance and economy.

How trading jargon came about, when and how certain financial securities were created for the first time.

Best of all it is written in an easy to read format that is easy to understand. The book felt a little rushed through the period after the Great Depression, however. I imagine as we understand more about the 2007-2008 crisis with hindsight on our side that there will be future additions of this book. I enjoyed reading about the many parallels between the depression error and the 2008-2008 Great Recession. \n         ', u'\n           \n           Geisst did an adequate job in conveying the information to the readers. Things started to make sense until he got to the 1930s then he lost me. Things were too complicated and he wrote like it was the tangled web of regulation that is probably was. Unfortunately, I needed clarity not complication. I rate this a "4" because he does a wonderful job leading us from 1791 to 1929, and again from 1947 to 1980.

I understand that this woman is a doctor and I get that she thinks she was doing the world a favor by explaining why women are the way they are.

Not that she doesn\'t have a right to spew her drivel on the world, but damn, do I wish that no one would ever read it.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Chauvinists around the world will thank Dr. Brizendine for her pop-science oversimplification excuse of a book that will add a modicum of misplaced credibility to the belief that women are powerless over their emotions an hormones."Don\'t tell me it\'s not your period, honey! Dr. Brizendine proved that you are powerless over the hormones in your brain! It\'s ok!" *pat,pat* "Why don\'t you take a Xanax and zone out in front of an episode of Grey\'s?"This book irritated me beyond belief. I think any person with a decent education understands that brain chemistry is a huge factor in human behavior. However, Dr. Brizendine uses it as an excuse and cop-out for everything. Her attitude for handling life in the face of what she seems to think are insurmountable hormones, is to medicate it all away. Is your teenage daughter pouty and rebellious? Give her drugs! Don\'t bother to worry about the effects these drugs might have on her developing brain. After all, you just want her to stop being a problem so you can get back to your life, right? What? In generations past, the young girl would have been taught to deal with her raging emotions and she would have been expected to live by family guidelines whether she liked it or not? Pssshaw. That would be too much work! Instead, teach her that she is powerless over her fleeting whims and how she can use that as an awesome justification for doing whatever the heck she wants whenever she wants. Yes. Drug her. DRUG HER. The book goes on to justify:~Women putting up with shitty treatment from men.~Ignoring their husband\'s needs after children arrive~Being unreasonably emotional in any situation~Ending their marriages after their children leaveI think Dr. Brizendine\'s message could be summed up by saying, "Women aren\'t responsible for their actions. And thus, you can discount them whenever you want."\n         ', u'\n           \n           The way some men talk about women I\'d assumed they\'d think The Female Brain was a work of fiction, "\'Cuzzin\' womens ain\'t got none brains, heeyuck, heeyuck!" It\'s too bad that most of those guys are illiterate, because they\'re the ones that need to read this the most.In The Female Brain, neuropsychiatrist Dr. Louann Brizendine uses clinical research and the experience of counseling patients to examine how the many various hormones flowing through a woman\'s body may affect their actions and behavior. It covers the emotional development and brain processes of women through the various stages of their lives, beginning at the beginning with childhood, moving through the tumultuous teens and the horror that is puberty and progress through womanhood into old age. The use of science to dissect human behavior is tricky since our moods, reactions, etc are slippery little fish. Brizendine\'s use of animal research raises validity questions (I.E. rats are not humans, so how can it apply?), however she is the first to admit that none of this is 100% pure, unadulterated fact. Just the same, there are some insights within The Female Brain that appear to be highly probable cause-effect truths, and even if they\'re not, this whole subject is still very fascinating! I found the entire book entertaining and, admittedly, quite a bit of it to be enlightening, as I imagine it might be to most men. Even some women would do well to give this a read, because how often do you hear yourself say something like, "Sometimes I just don\'t understand my mother/daughter!"?\n         ', u'\n           \n           I stopped reading this book on page 68.It\'s amazing I made it that far. Part of me thinks I should finish the book because I should know what is inside. People not only like to come to me for gender advice, but also test my boundaries on "gender roles." A friend loaned me this book, I believe as a way to see what my expert opinion of it would be. I have no idea how she feels about it.It frightens me to think this was a NY Times Best Seller. Oh, the masses who read this and loved it!You know what made me finally put this book down?*It wasn\'t her pointing out that female and male brains work in different ways. *It wasn\'t her stating on page 8 that a female engineer quit her work to be in a more people-oriented career, thus giving more credibility to the idea that engineers don\'t work with people or for people.*It wasn\'t even when she dug up the old "I gave my daughter a truck and she treated it like a baby" clich\xe9.*It was almost when she says men look for visual clues (plump lips, smooth skin) to ensure fertility when looking for women to date.It was her slut shaming. In the chapter about how the female brain works in the areas of love and trust, she states: (Warning, put that cup down and swallow that bite) "Social reputation is often a factor in male assessment, since the most reproductively successful males also need to pick women who will mate only with them. Men want to ensure their paternity but also to be able to count on a woman\'s mothers skills to make sure that their offspring thrive. If Melissa had immediately gone to bed with Rob or showed off to him about all the guys she has had, his Stone Age brain might have judged that she would be unfaithful or had a bad reputation." Go ahead, read that passage again. Yes, you read it correctly. Cave men don\'t want slutty women to hook up with.There\'s a lot of research in here and a lot of medical terms that aren\'t clearly explained. But from all the things on gender that I have learned from reading outside and inside the classroom and the science background I have, I have to say that this person takes facts and uses a huge rubber band to tie it to normative behavior. Instead of this book, pick up Pink Brain, Blue Brain. Sure it\'s 2-3 times longer, but it doesn\'t traffic in stereotypes and certainly believes that we have evolved from the Stone Age. A reader suggested Cordelia Fine\'s "Delusion of Gender" as another alternative to "The Female Brain." http://www.cordeliafine.com/delusions...Have other suggestions? Keep them coming!\n', u"\n           \n           The takeaway from this book is that the average woman is a hyper-sensitive control freak ruled by hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, testosterone in the same way that some people feel they're controlled by the movement of the stars. These hormones in turn are determined by a combination of genetics and rearing but developed over time as a reaction to evolutionary necessities. All of which enforce behavior which you know of as a set of common stereotypes. There's not much scientific data to back up these claims but that doesn't stop Luann Brizendine, MD. This writing itself is awful -- an overly breezy example of the worst of pop science. It reads like a long magazine article written in a chatty style which among other things is directed towards an exclusively female audience. Worse, the science is poor, relying mostly on case study from private practice and completely irrelevant animal studies giving 0 background on studies. Just reporting findings is fine in these kind of books, but they should at least make a coherent argument. Example: Brizendine describes a rat experiment wherein researchers rubbed a local anesthetic on a mother rat's mammaries. Brizendine claims that the lack of sensation resulted in lack of bonding between pup and mother, and these poor rat pups as a consequence suffered from a host of problems later in the experiment. Therefore, a woman should breast-feed. Wow -- I think I need a little more information before I can accept that line of reasoning.On the other hand, I do think that brain chemistry is extremely important in determining our moods and behavior. I can buy the basic premise. The problem is that I'm not interested in why so many women exhibit stereotypical behavior. I'm more interested in the how. How does estrogen protect brain cells? How does oxytocin create feelings of relaxation? What is an emotion, and how do you know you're having one anyways? Is sadness for a woman the same thing as sadness for me? Really, I'm not interested in why women like rich, good looking, attentive guys (compared to what? poor, ugly, insensitve guys?). I'm more interested in how they know and how they evaluate what they see and feel and how that differs from the way I see myself. None of these questions even get asked. It's a crying shame. \n"], 0]!!!![u'24332054', u'A Taste of Paradise', u'192', u'\n61189\nMargaret Mayo\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1314185575p5/61189.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1314185575p2/61189.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61189.Margaret_Mayo\n3.12\n1454\n158\n', u'1981', u'', u'', u'Mills & Boon', u'<b>Every paradise has to have its serpent</b><br />An island in the Indian Ocean as a wedding present!

But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. In other words, they focus on the original meaning of the passage but don't discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable -- but the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps us with both halves of the interpretive task. This new and unique series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into modern context. It explains not only what the Bible means but also how it can speak powerfully today.", u'153', u'3.97', u'59', [], [u'\nI only, read the last 2/3 of the book; I do not own it but had it on hold from the library for a sermon series I was preaching and it did not arrive until after the first few weeks.p. 118 [1 Peter 2:1-10]Peter\'s and our worlds dramatically differ...that means we must be careful of importing a world (which does not exist for modern Westerners) rather than importing theological direction for the church. The entire sweep of the Bible teaches that Christians in non-Christian environments are not to be worried so much about changing their environments as they are to remain faithful in whatever kind of environment they find themselves. In fact, the New Testament is unified on this point: Christian teaching concerns Christian theology and behavior, not social institutions and how they might be changed. Accordingly, the tasks of the church are transnational and universal, not culturally restricted. Thus, the mission of the church as defined by Peter here helps to form, and together with the rest of the New Testament does form, the foundation of the church\'s mission everywhere and in all ages.p. 134 [1 Peter 2:11-12]The most obvious cultural symbol that Peter provides his readers is a new term of identity: they are "aliens and strangers." This identity-forming expression provides a way of understanding both their social location and the spiritual basis for that location. Society may see them as excluded, but Peter appropriates these terms of censure for a new category of the spiritually gifted. What was then a term of criticism becomes a badge of merit. Because they are the church (a symbol) and although they are socially excluded (a symbol), they can live holy lives (a symbol) in the midst of tribulation as they look forward to the day of judgment (a symbol).p. 157 [1 Peter 2:13-17]Peter preaches submission in order to prevent the government from turning against the church as well as to encourage others to follow Christ through the church. And as long as church members live within the order of society and do not live recklessly outside of that society\'s standards, and as long as the government does not turn against them for this kind of action, then social acts of civil disobedience will be perceived as "citizen-like behavior." In this sense, actions of this sort will not harm the cause of the gospel.p. 159-[1 Peter 2:13-17]Christians ought to be known for their respect and even-handed work in governmental and political actions. Sadly, this is not how they are always known today. Many Christians who are candid about their faith and political action are also known for being obstreperous [?] in their political action. Too often the Christian right is disrespectful of the left. I have heard far too many nasty, even unchristian, remarks about political parties in power that differ with the Christian right wing. And I suppose that the same kind of remarks are made about politicians of the other variety by those on the opposite side. We must remember that Peter\'s remarks were in the context of showing respect for all people, regardless of their partisan politics (2:17). Our motivation for political activity needs to be set in the context of our mission as a church. Too often political activity by Christians seems to have so little Christian motivation that it betrays what we are all about. Our first task is to glorify God by bringing the good news of the gospel to bear on our world. If our political activity is not drenched in that motivation and is instead only slightly stained (work as hard as possible to appear nonreligious and acceptable) by the message of the kingdom, then we are denying the purpose of our existence. Peter motivated the churches to good actions in their world so that they would declare forth the good news of God and demonstrate his goodness and glory, in the hope that others would want to become Christians. He did not exhort them to do good for some altruistic motive. Far too often Christians are involved, or at least get involved, to protect their own investments or to accumulate more power for themselves. These are not worthy motives for those of us who claim to follow Jesus Christ and the pattern of the apostles.p. 160-161 [Gerald R. McDermott, professor of religion at Roanoke College, summary of Jonathan Edwards\' theology of public life for the Christian.1. Christians have a responsibility to society beyond the walls of the church. Christians must break through the tendency to isolationism that has at times characterized the church.2. Christians should not hesitate to join forces with non-Christians in the public square to work toward common moral goals.3. Christians should support their governments but be ready to criticize them when the occasion demands. 4. Christians should remember that politics is comparatively unimportant in the long run5. Christians should beware of national pride. In the history of the church there has never been a truly Christian nation. Until that does occur (and we have reason to doubt that it ever will), we are obliged to put our pride on the back burner and put our trust in the kingdom of God, which transcends national borders.6. Christians should care for the poor...Christians ought to help, and ought to want to help, those who are in need, whatever those needs are. Furthermore, they ought to extend this desire into a plan for the government to help.p. 192 [On Peter\'s concept of submission in 1 Peter 3:1-7][Quoting another churchman] "I believe in a wife submitting to her husband, but I don\'t believe the husband ever has the right to demand it. In fact, I know that when I am worthy of submission, my wife submits; and when I am unworthy of it, she does not. My responsibility as a husband is to be worthy." That is the point! When a husband focuses on submission and the wife worries about it, the image of marriage is distorted. But when each focuses on the mutual responsibility to love and serve one another, the image of marriage is clear and beautiful.p. 208-[On church as community-1 Peter 3:8-12][Churches should...]perceptively discern to see if they truly function as a community where people are led to the holy love of God (the Father of the family), where that same love dominates the relationships and programs within that church (the nerve of the family), and where that love is known in the larger society as the characteristic of that church (the mark of the family).p. 232-[On 1 Peter 4:1-6] We see here the Christocentric nature of early Christian theology, which I contrast with the moralistic nature of much of modern Christian theology. It is not uncommon to hear today that Gandhi was Christian in much of what he did, especially in his pacifistic and gentle wisdom, but if we say this, we lose the Christocentric anchor of our faith. To be sure, Gandhi was a wonderful, pious man, but behavior is only Christian when it is consciously obedient to Jesus Christ There are clear parallels, particularly at the moral level, among various religions in the world; but if Jesus Christ is eliminated from the picture, a moral practice is not Christian. Peter anchors his moral practice (suffering unjustly) in the example of Jesus, thus giving it a different basis and motivation. Christians are to suffer, not because suffering makes them better people (which it can do), nor because it makes them conscious of a higher world (which it can also do), but because Jesus himself suffered--and they are his followers.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I\'m using this commentary to prepare a series of sermons and bible classes on 1 Peter. I have found McKnight to be a very valuable companion to read alongside my own study and wrestling with the text. This is not a technical commentary. It does do a good job of bridging the contexts of the world of the text illuminated by biblical scholarship and the contexts of American Christians in our world today. Even if that "world of today" happens to be 20 years ago when this commentary was published - it still feels remarkably current to me. I\'d recommend for students of 1 Peter, especially those preaching or teaching.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I like this series for what it offers a preacher, and I found the insights here on "bridging contexts" to often be quite valuable. Unlike Darrell Bock on Luke (in the same series), I didn\'t find McKnight\'s thoughts on "original meaning" to be as compelling, and like Bock I sometimes felt McKnight\'s "contemporary significance" reflections missed the mark. Another difficulty I had was that my outline of 1 Peter didn\'t match McKnight\'s, so often I was jumping around or poking into half a chapter. All of this combined to make this round from the series less helpful than others have been, but I still got value out of it. This was probably the first go-to commentary of my second-tier references.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I enjoy reading the NIV application series commentaries for help with my sermon prep, and I always enjoy the thoughts of Scot McKnight. This was a good marriage of the two. It walks the fine line reasonably well between being scholarly enough, but easily read and applicable at the same time. Other commentaries are more scholarly (Karen Jobes), while some others are quicker reads (Gundry) but this was helpful in both regards. Well worth the time to read.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I\'ve used this series in the past (Luke by D. Bock and Isaiah by J. Oswalt) and find them very helpful in sermon prep.

Set in the small town of Beauval, where everyone knows everyone, this is a dark literary novel that explores crime and punishment with regard to Antoine. It all begins with Ulysses, a dog that is hit by a car, and is then shot to put it out of its misery. Banned from being with friends obsessed with games on playstations, a solitary Antoine finds comfort and companionship with Ulysses. He is desperately upset and distressed in the woods, where he had been secretly constructing a tree house when Remi's death occurs. His vivid imagination supplies him with fearsome consequent scenarios that would befall him as a child murderer and how it would affect his mother, this drives his decision to hide the body in the woods.Lemaitre paints a picture of a small community, seething with petty jealousies and resentments, that initially comes to organise searches for the missing Remi. The police are called in, and question a highly stressed boy slowly coming apart as he thinks of running away. Rumours and suspicions abound, fuelled by arrests of a teacher and Monsieur Kowalski, aka Frankenstein, a butcher for whom Madame Courtin works. His mother views Kowalski with contempt, so Antoine feels no remorse for what the butcher has to go through. His concern is for himself as he imagines himself being hauled in for the murder as the community are in the process of searching the woods. Antoine escapes detection as devastating storms and floods splinter peoples lives apart, and the business of surviving and rebuilding becomes the overriding priority and the search for Remi disintegrates. Antoine's life moves on but he can never forget. He becomes a medic and is engaged to Laura when at his mother's insistence he returns to Beauval for a party. A careless drunken sexual act with someone from the past has unexpected repercussions for Antoine as Remi's body is discovered.Lemaitre displays a real talent in being able to enter the mind of a 12 year old boy and capture the tumultuous feelings, stresses and emotions in a way that feels so desperately authentic. All this is achieved amidst the background of Beauval, riddled with a morass of human frailties and personal relationships with a long history, so some seek vengeance and judgement at the most inappropriate times, displaying their inhumanity in public. All this history shapes the community response to the missing Remi and his family, and their commitment to finding him. This is a story of twists, suspense and dark thrills. It takes as its starting point a 12 year old boy who finds himself committing an act he never meant, and then follows through on its implications, many unexpected, and how they define Antoine's entire life. It raises issues of morality and asks whether what happens to Antoine is punishment enough? Is it too much? What would have happened if Antoine had been honest? If you are looking for something different in the field of psychological crime fiction, this would be an excellent novel to read. Many thanks to Quercus for an ARC.\n         ", u"\n           \n           This s a psychological novel in the truest sense. A young 12 year old boy, Antoine, commits an horrible act, accidentally but he hides the evidence. Twelve years later he makes another mistake, which will alter his life's path. These two mistakes will haunt him, and it is the chance of discovery of his first act that creates the suspense, his second mistake will help bring things full circle.I never read this authors first three, highly rated books because from the many trusted reviews I read I felt they might be too grisly for me. This one was close to perfect. Any author that can create such a feeling of suspense, without resorting to untold violence, descriptions of blood and gore, with characters it is easy to dislike, and do it as well as I thought this author did, is a fantastic writer in my book. The feelings of desperation that haunt Antoine at times, trying to figure out what to do, where to go, were fantastically portrayed. How the author ties up the loose ends and brings everything to a surprising close was amazingly done. Was quite blown away by this book, dark yes but a satisfying read. Just when you think you were ready to give up psychologically twisty novels, one like this comes along, and makes one second guess themselves. ARC from Netgalley.\n         ", u"\n           \n           A slow book that crawls along but keeps your attention, even if it's hard to like or identify with the main character. Antoine is a man whose life has been shaped and molded by two terrible decisions twelve years apart. As a child, he lashed out in violence... resulting in the death of a six year old friend. Twelve years later, as a man who has never faced punishment for that crime, he cheats on the woman he loves. Both of these actions irrevocably change his life. Considering how far apart these actions take place, you'd think they'd be spoilers... but they aren't. They're both featured in the blurb for the book. This story isn't really about mystery or suspense, it's about Antoine. He's a man who despite everything, has his freedom, a promising future as a doctor, and the love of a good woman... but can he hold onto them? An enjoyable piece of noir fiction, and a quick read at just over 200 pages. I read it in two sittings. It was quite different from the books I usually pick up, but I'm glad I did. At times the names and characters were hard to keep track of, so I was happy to read an e-book where I could easily highlight and look back. This book won't be for every mystery fan, but if you're in the mood for a slow burn more character driven and a little different, give it a shot.

A true psychological study, into what happens when the wrong path is taken. Lemaitre gives us the most chilling account of a few days in the life of a child killer. It is incredible.Three Days and a Life follows a twelve year old boy, in a rural town in France. Antoine seems to be an average lad, on the brink of being a teenager. He comes from a single parent family. He is lives in the very uninspiring Beauvil. The time is 1999, so it is set within recent memory. Antoine is devastated, when a neighbour's dog is killed. He loved that dog. This seems to set off a chain of events.Antoine accidently kills a neighbour's child. It is a moment of rage, directed inappropriately. Instead of holding up his hand and admitting to the crime, Antoine makes a curious choice. He decides to hide the body and pretend it didn't happen. He does not tell another soul. He walks away. His decision leads to increasing guilt. We quickly see that Antoine is suffering a living hell. He becomes very fearful of being exposed. All the scenerios that could possibly take place race through his mind. We hear his psychological agony. He is trapped. He fears than at any moment fingers will point in his direction. Guilty! He wants to run away. He cannot even access his saving's accounts. So he has to stay. Reni, a six year old local boy, is soon declared missing. Everyone is looking for him. What happened to Reni? Only Antoine knows the truth.The beauty of Three Days and a Life is that we believe in Antoine. His voice as a child is very strong. It is an authentic account of escalating tension and fear. Very moving. Antoine could easily speak out and tell the truth. Time and time again, he chooses not to. We get a glimpse into an adult Antoine. This man bears the scars of murder. Antoine behaves like an arrogant idiot, with a recklessness that catches up with him.I loved this. Lemaitre is an expert, at exploring the horror of Antoine's unique situation. Anyone who wants to know how to write escalating tension and true pyschological fear, should read this. Marvellous! Totally recommended.\n", u"\n           \n           Read my full review: http://crimebythebook.com/blog/2017/8... This one is very, VERY different from Lemaitre's previous books. Reviewing it was actually so difficult -- I review every book from a crime reader perspective, and this book most likely won't be the right choice for crime readers. It's better understood as an interpersonal drama and a portrait of a man growing up under the burden of a terrible secret from his childhood. I highly recommend Lemaitre's backlist for crime fiction readers (BLOOD WEDDING is absolutely brilliant!), but definitely read my full review before purchasing this one. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'10795816', u'Made, Concerto Pour Salmen Et Boh\xe8me', u' ', u'\n873466\nAyerdhal\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371663398p5/873466.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371663398p2/873466.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/873466.Ayerdhal\n3.77\n439\n46\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'10', u'3.60', u'5', [], [], 0]!!!![u'30351977', u'L R Wright', u' ', u'\n4412800\nL R Wright\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4412800.L_R_Wright\n3.90\n10\n1\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'2', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'22274339', u'The Menai Strait', u'116', u'\n8257296\nGwyn Pari Huws\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8257296.Gwyn_Pari_Huws\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2003', u'12', u'1', u'Gomer Press', u"A spectacular journey, undertaken in words and pictures along one of Wales's most magical coastlines.", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28265673', u'Building Contracts and Practice', u' ', u'\n5680860\nEmden\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5680860.Emden\n2.50\n2\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'25893404', u'English Corpus Linguistics: An Introduction', u' ', u'\n1143903\nCharles F.

ugly movie cover, and switch to the one i actually read....okay, better.this was my final selection for the readventurer challenge. i read them alphabetically, based on the suggester\'s first name, for arbitrary fairness.it is strange that i have never read this book, as it is magical realism, doomed love story, and about food, all of which are interests of mine.here is a quick story that has nothing to do with the book, and i am going to put it in a spoiler for everyone who thinks i am too personal in my book reports, but:(view spoiler)[ so this is one of those books i always thought you either read in high school, or you just never read. my AP english class senior year, i had a teacher i loved. i had him for three classes that year, and he was the "cool" teacher with the chuck taylors and the ponytail, the irreverent one who cursed and treated high school kids like sentient beings, went by a nickname, and about whom there were rumors of indiscretions (of the drugs-and-alcohol sort, not the other kind). but he was also a canon-adherer. basically - white european males. all the time. (although we did read little foxes, so there was one lady.) the other AP class was a much more "hey, let\'s read a range of perspectives" syllabus. and a bunch of people dropped out of his class to go to t\'other, and by the end we were down to like nine students, which was great for me, but probably reflected poorly on him. but he was completely unapologetic about it, "if women of brewster place was as good a book as heart of darkness, we would read women of brewster place." and in a way - dick, right? but he was a great teacher, narrow perspective aside, and i learned so much in that class, even though i had to read heart of darkness, which - yes - a great book for structure and themes and resonance, but such a snooze. so anyway, i know the other class read this book, and it is always on the school reading lists i have to fetch books for at the job, but i probably never would have read it without tatiana\'s suggestion, because i consider it a book that i had missed the boat on, associating it as i do with high school reading lists, and i am old. when i sat down this morning to write this review, i decided to see if i could find out what old roz was up to.http://florida.arrests.org/Arrests/Be...aaaaaand there it is. god, i love this man. don\'t let them get you, roz!! drive recklessly into the night!!! okay, that\'s all (hide spoiler)]so, the book. this thing is assigned to junior and high school students?? man, no wonder the teen pregnancy rates are where they are. this is a very sensual book. there are peeping toms, intercourse on horseback, the pouring of a frustrated libido into food-preparation, and lovemaking that causes actual sparks, and in one case, death. this is not a spoiler, because i\'m not giving names, and you probably already read this in your progressively anti-canon high school classes.i am not a fan of romance, unless it is the forbidden, doomed romance of something like wuthering heights. and this one is doomed. tita is destined to remain unmarried and childless, trapped in the family tradition that the youngest daughter is entrusted with the care of her mother until her death. bum deal, especially since she has fallen into passionate, reciprocal love with pedro, who ends up marrying her sister just to remain close to tita. terrible plan, by the way.so her life becomes resentment and frustration, and food. tita is the one who is preserving all the family\'s traditional recipes, the ones that take all day to make, the ones that are served on special occasions, the ones that require not only ingredients, but are also flavored with the cook\'s mood. and these moods are wild and powerful, and affect all who eat the food in different ways.this book reads almost like a folk- or fairy-tale. the magical realism is of the emotional variety, with ghosts and the physical manifestations of internal passions, rather than the magic standing in for larger social or political themes, which are present, but only as background detail. the focus here is on character. the book is structured into twelve chapters, each one representing a month, january-december, but the action takes place over a number of years, so the significance of this is unclear to me. however, what is not unclear is that every chapter opens with a recipe, and from the first one, "christmas rolls," esquivel had my attention. sardines, chorizo, onion, oregano, and serrano chiles, tucked into a roll.yeah, this is how you open a book.it s incredibly fast-paced, and the recipes don\'t feel like they are taking you away from the action, they are enhancing it with a structure that is completely relevant to the action.not crazy about the ending, but i definitely liked the rest of it. it awakened my senses, it made me hungry and happy and sad and all the shades in-between. and quite saucy, actually...she felt so lost and lonely. one last chile in walnut sauce left on the platter after a fancy dinner couldn\'t feel any worse than she did. how many times had she eaten one of those treats, standing by herself in the kitchen, rather than let it be thrown away. when nobody eats the last chile on the plate, it\'s usually because none of them wants to look like a glutton, so even though they\'d really like to devour it, they don\'t have the nerve to take it. it was as if they were rejecting that stuffed pepper, which contains every imaginable flavor; sweet as candied citron, juicy as a pomegranate, with the bit of pepper and subtlety of walnuts, that marvelous chile in walnut sauce. within it lies the secret of love, but it will never be penetrated, and all because it wouldn\'t be proper.i think we all know what is going on here, don\'t we?so - maybe not as enduring as heart of darkness, but much, much spicier.\n', u'\n\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u067e\u062e\u062a \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0622\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0634\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0645\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645:\u06cc\u06a9 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u06a9 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0628\u062f\u0633\u0647 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0645\u062b\u0644\u062b \u0639\u0634\u0642\u06cc (\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0632\u0648\u062f)\u0633\u0646\u062a \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0634\u06a9\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0632\u062f\u0647 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0622\u0634\u067e\u0632\u06cc \u0639\u062c\u06cc\u0628 \u0648 \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u0648 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u062a\u0647\u06cc\u0647:\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0627\u0632\u062f\u0647 \u0642\u0637\u0639\u0647 \u062a\u0642\u0633\u06cc\u0645 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0647\u0631 \u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0622\u0634\u067e\u0632\u06cc \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0647\u06cc\u062f. \u062f\u0631 \u0636\u0645\u0646\u0650 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0634 \u062a\u0647\u06cc\u0647 \u063a\u0630\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u060c \u0647\u0631 \u062c\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0632 \u0634\u062f \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0628\u062f \u0648 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0634\u06a9 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0648\u0637 \u0627\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u060c \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0632\u0646\u06cc\u062f. \u0645\u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0627\u064b \u062f\u0642\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u06a9 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0626\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u062c\u0627\u062f\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u063a\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc\u0628 \u0634\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0637\u0639\u0645 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u062d \u063a\u0630\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u062f\u0647\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0651\u06cc \u0645\u0647\u0644\u06a9 \u06cc\u0627 \u0634\u0647\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0647\u0634\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f. \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0634\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u060c \u0645\u062b\u0644\u062b \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0634\u0642\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u0641\u0632\u0627\u064a\u064a\u062f. \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0622\u0645\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a.\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f...\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u067e\u062e\u062a \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0637\u0627\u0639\u0648\u0646\n         ', u"\n           \n           What a wonderful, magical story. The tale of women in turn-of-the-century Mexico and how they live their lives. Tita is the main character and what a strong woman she is. This story is told in 12 month chapters though time progresses much faster. Each chapter is started with a recipe. Yes, the kitchen and food is central to this story. You get the details of the recipe and how to make and it's weaved so perfectly into this story. In a nutshell, Tita is the youngest of three girls. They live on their ranch with their mother, Mama Elena. Let's just say Joan Crawford, ala Mommie Dearest, has *nothing* on Mama Elena. Tita is in love with Pedro, a local boy, but custom dictates that the youngest child, Tita, is not allowed to marry and must care for her mother until the day she dies. Care for really means be a slave to her and her abusive ways. Mama Elena is so cruel that she has Tita's sister marry Pedro and makes Tita cook the meal for their wedding. Tita can infuse her emotions into the food that she is cooking. As she cries and pours her tears of sorrow into the cake for her sister's wedding, something happens. Everyone at the wedding becomes sorrowful and is sick. Naturally she is accused of destroying the wedding. There are other tales of Tita's emotions being put into the food she makes. I especially loved the story of passion in the food that her older sister ate and the passion just exploded in her.Oh there is so much magical realism in this one and I just loved it. I'm a big fan of magical realism and food. So put the two together and it's a wonderful tale. I have been wanting to read this one for so long. I picked up a copy on a library sale and started it earlier this year, but after the first paragraph I knew I had to save it. It started 'Take care to chop the onion fine' and I knew I wanted to save it for my vacation where I could just immerse myself in this story without interruptions. Though that didn't go as actually planned, as too many distractions.I could not help but keep comparing this work to Isabel Allende's work. Both have that magical realism element to it, a sweeping family saga, such heartbreak, and just a beautiful story. I'm so glad I finally read this one as now I can actually watch the movie version.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'16015987', u'Verschil moet er zijn', u' ', u'\n4578229\nGrethe van Geffen\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4578229.Grethe_van_Geffen\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'Business Contact', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'17405901', u'Sainis', u' ', u'\n2888316\nAlberts Bels\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1341837791p5/2888316.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1341837791p2/2888316.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2888316.Alberts_Bels\n3.86\n741\n27\n', u'1980', u'', u'', u'Liesma', u'St\u0101sti un noveles', u'8', u'4.00', u'4', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29595718', u'Handwriting For Lefties', u' ', u'\n14679095\nJoshua Schuger\nEditor\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14679095.Joshua_Schuger\n2.40\n5\n1\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'3.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29944454', u'Dziewczyna w ciemno\u015bci', u'240', u'\n8326278\nAnna Lyndsey\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8326278.Anna_Lyndsey\n3.56\n2277\n391\n', u'2015', u'9', u'30', u'Agora SA', u'Anna was living a normal life.

Soon this progressed to an intolerance of fluorescent light, then of sunlight itself. The reaction soon spread to her entire body. Now, when her symptoms are at their worst, she must spend months on end in a blacked-out room, losing herself in audio books and elaborate word games in an attempt to ward off despair. It was during this period she began to write this book.', u'8726', u'3.56', u'2277', [(u'to-read', 5966), (u'non-fiction', 163), (u'memoir', 158), (u'nonfiction', 81), (u'currently-reading', 72)], [u'\nFurther Update I can\'t get this book out of my head. The author was a power freak. Whether it was her husband, doctors, councils, she wanted control over everything. I\'m not saying this is conscious, but a physical disease that is so extreme but tests completely normal is ... not normal. And God said, "Let there be light" and she the author said, "No!".______Update Just a thought. I read that the author\'s name is a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She shrouds herself in black, travels in a car that has a lightproof \'tent\' inside and goes out only in the gloom to protect her skin. She absolutely refuses to consider various doctor\'s opinions that her disease is psychosomatic. She does everything she can to keep out the light but refuses to change her life to where she wouldn\'t need to (like moving to where there is less daylight as I\'ve written below). She says her friends have drifted off partly because she lives in such an isolated place. I just wonder if there isn\'t some mental ailment of wanting extreme privacy? I\'m probably adding two and two and getting five here, but... But a pseudonym for reasons of privacy in a straight non-contentious memoir... I don\'t know, just made me think.______This should have been a really interesting story, and that is why I picked it up. A woman in her thirties (although she always refers to herself as a girl) is stricken with a photosensitivity so extreme that there are only two sufferers at this level in the entire UK. It started with her face burning from a computer screen so she had to give up her high-level government job and could only go out wearing face masks and hats, looking peculiar. (This is about 2005 when there weren\'t too many politicised Islamic niqab-wearing women, but enough. She could have put on a burkha and no one would have stared, as she said they did). Eventually the burning sensititivy progressed to her entire body and she lived in blacked-out rooms wearing dark clothes and only going out at dusk and before dawn. Confined to her house, she cancelled medical appointments, her wedding and visits to friends. She employed an assistant to sit in the next room on a computer, although why she couldn\'t have used a computer without the screen on or a screen in the next room herself with a text reader is not explained. She tries many treatments from conventional medications to the long-shots like acupuncture and the ridiculous like carrying a crystal. The disease does improve, but then again she relapses and it never entirely leaves her. So she begins to write this book in the dark with her thumb holding her place. Like it was before technology, like it was the dark ages, well I suppose it was to her.Up to this point the writing was overblown, word games were described in full with examples, there was never an adjective when two would do. Or an adjective plus a simile and a couple of adverbs. Creative-writing at it\'s very finest... at least it appeals to blurb writers and some reviewers who almost unanimously praise its \'lyrical prose. To me however, I could live without the \'setting sun sinks luxuriously beneath the foamy pink clouds, its work complete\'. That\'s just padding. Padding because there really isn\'t much of a story to tell.I was sorry for the woman. But I didn\'t like her. I understand her self-pitying attitude, the arrogance not so much. I didn\'t understand her desire to live as normally as she could without making adapations other than it being dark. She had a light meter, like a camera, which measured her disease as it waxed and waned, at what stage the light would be dim enough for her to go out and garden and when she would need to live in full blackout. If there are alternatives why wouldn\'t you try them? She knew that her majority problem with light lay at the blue end of the spectrum (UV light), so I thought she would try red light (entirely non-UV), as in photographic dark rooms, but no. She is ok for a short while with the kind of street lights that use a sodium-vapour technology which produce light from the yellow end of the spectrum. So why not yellow bug-lights? What about moving to the north of Scotland for the winter - there are very few hours of daylight there and no what you might call bright sunlight at all. But nothing. I don\'t understand this mindset of soldiering through, not exploring all avenues that might lead to a better quality of life, and then complaining about it. She does get married, late afternoon in a church lit with candles and then a reception in a marquee in the garden of their house. I don\'t know how it was lit! Here she is talking of how her husband brings her things."Roses and apples make up my memories. the roses were cut for me by Pete and glowed darkly in the curtained living room scenting the shadowy air. I would lift the vases to my face and press my nose to the velvety depths and breathe and breathe as if each flower were the mouth of a pipe connecting me to the world. The apples piled up in boxes on the kitchen floor. Enormous, shining warm from the sun, astonishgly perfect, endless. I would go into the kitchen just to gaze. They seemed an unasked for slightly inconvenient miracle performed on the apple tree by a passing angel in randomly benevolent mood unaware of the girl inside the house who would have liked a miracle for herself."The book was hard for me to read with all the prose described by some as \'lyrical\' and \'beautiful\'. Maybe I lack a poetic gene? Maybe I read too much non-fiction which tends to stick to the point? To me this is self-indulgent writing that lacks the elucidating flash of inspiration that poetry can have and just fills up space.It\'s a 2-star book. Writing about clothing, curtains and cures that didn\'t work and padding it out with great gobs of flowery prose didn\'t do it for me. But then 3 stars because although I didn\'t like her, I do feel great sympathy for the author who really hasn\'t got much of a life at all. I hope she gets better. I hope her writing does too._____As a conclusion, having thought it over, I do wonder why there was much technology not explored by the author. Why was she so determined to make as few adaptions as possible, other than living in the dark? Why was she so vehemently opposed to the doctors\' suggestions that this might be psychosomatic? In other words, did she protest too much?\n         ', u'\n           \n           This is one of the most beautifully written and yet harrowing memoirs I\'ve ever read.Anna suffers from a rare skin condition that makes her severely sensitive to light. It started out that she couldn\'t tolerate her glowing computer screen at work \u2014 she said it felt like someone was holding a blowtorch in front of her face. Then the sensitivity spread to the rest of her body, and even when she was fully clothed, the light waves would irritate her skin. So Anna (a pen name) was forced to become a Girl in the Dark. She blacked out a room in her home, not allowing any light in at all. If she stayed in darkness most of the day, her skin built up some resistance and she could tolerate low levels of light for a little while in the evening.I know I do not have much time. Immediately I leave my blacked-out room, a clock is ticking; my skin begins its twisted dialogue with light. At first the exchange takes place in softest whispers, then more insistent mutterings. "Ignore it!" I want to scream. "You don\'t have to respond, don\'t get involved." But my skin soon chatters loudly, an argument is building. The situation is becoming heated; it is prudent to separate the protagonists. There are no blisters and no blotches -- I am free of visible signs of conflict. But agonisingly, with ever-increasing ferocity, over the whole covering of my body, I burn with invisible fire. I take my skin back to my lair. In the darkness, it regains its equilibrium.Doctors didn\'t know what to do and scant research was available on her condition. Anna tried dozens of remedies with little success. Sometimes she has a remission and can go outside after sunset, but never for very long. Other times she feels like she is burning up and she has to scurry to a blackened room.But Anna still has joy in her life. She has a helpful and loving husband, and she takes delight in listening to audiobooks during her hours in the dark. Anna also started a new career as a private piano instructor, so she could work at home and control the lighting.In the author\'s note, Anna joked that her story might not seem very engaging, given that this is her basic timeline:Monday: stayed in darkTuesday: stayed in darkWednesday: stayed in darkEven I, a novice, realized that as literature it lacked a certain vim.But Anna made her story interesting by writing of her gradual intolerance to light, and her struggle to find information or doctors who could help. She and her husband also figured out ways to make brief excursions after dusk, rigging up a black-out curtain in the backseat of the car. The book is essentially a survival story, seeing how one woman adapted to an extreme change in lifestyle.While reading this book, I frequently paused and considered how horrible it would be to feel so trapped by one\'s body. It made me grateful for the ability to move around in daylight, which I had always taken for granted. Anna\'s story was so thought-provoking and affecting that one evening I was reading it just before bed, and later that night I dreamt that my face was burned and fiery. I woke up in a panic, then was relieved to remember that I didn\'t suffer from Anna\'s condition. Since reading this, I\'ve been taking more time to appreciate the sunshine and being able to walk outdoors. It gives you a new perspective on your daily life.I am so impressed by Anna\'s resilience, and I am glad she found a way to share her story. I highly recommend this memoir.Favorite Quotes"My ears become my conduit to the world. In the darkness I listen \u2014 to thrillers, to detective novels, to romances; to family sagas, potboilers and historical novels; to ghost stories and classic fiction and chick lit; to bonkbusters and history books. I listen to good books and bad books, great books and terrible books; I do not discriminate. Steadily, hour after hour, in the darkness I consume them all.""When I finish a book, I find I cannot start another one immediately. Each book needs time to settle in my mind, to be digested like a meal of many courses. It seems disrespectful to the characters to move on too quickly \u2014 after all, I have spent hours in their company, learnt their histories, looked on at significant moments of their lives. I still have nagging questions echoing in my mind: surely someone would have noticed the substitution of the bodies? Why in American crime fiction do people eat so much pizza?""Animals in zoos and prisoners sleep many hours a day. Like them I have become a devotee, a voluptuary of sleep, a connoisseur of its intense, uncharted pleasures. Sleep slips the chains of this life, snaps the intimate fetters of my skin, sets me free to travel the wild landscapes of the ungoverned mind. Each night I enter by the same door, yet find behind it something new.

Anna Lyndsey (pen name) allows us glimpse of her black box life in this beautifully poetic memoir. If it is often emotionally devastating for the reader, envision that we get to go back to our world of light.It begins slowly with light sensitivity, burning facial skin when sitting in front of a computer screen. \u201dBurns? Burns like the worst kind of sunburn. Burns like someone is holding a flame-thrower to my head.The sensitivity to light progresses and Lyndsey\u2019s life is changed forever. Had she written Girl in the Dark in diary format, it may have kept my attention. Instead, she chose to present a group of essays in no particular order of occurrence making her story compelling. Lyndsey explains:\u201dEven I, as a novice, realized that as literature it lacked a certain vim. Clearly I had to abandon the chronological approach\u2026\u201dOpening the book we are invited in with this dedication \u201dFor my visitors\u201d and are immediately plunged into Lyndsey\u2019s quest to darken the light that is seeping in.  It is extraordinarily difficult to black out a room.\u201dThis whole first chapter takes us through the room blackening process. Blackout roller blinds, foil taped over the windowpanes, layer upon layer but the light creeps in. Eventually through trial and error she creates a satisfactory blackness. Her days are spent in vast amounts of time alone, listening to audio books, knitting even, and in the end discarding music as a pastime as it depresses her. She outlines recurring dreams and explains the rules of the games she plays when the blackness bores her or sleep won\u2019t come. She shares willingly her relationship with Pete, a love story that stacks up to the best. There are remissions but they never last. She does not seek sympathy for her fate though desired a different place to leave us. My book is marked with so many colorful sticky notes, red, green, purple. If I were to quote each passage that touched me I\u2019d be guilty of infringement. I will leave you with one more thought. In one piece titled Parallels Lyndsey cites her need to read books about people in extreme situations. She offers us four books that have elements in common with her situation, though not the same. Any of these would be worth reading.\u201dI covet tales of human beings in extremis; want to know how they felt, what they did, how they bore it.\u201dThis, in the end, may be why I found my way to Girl in the Dark. It is an exquisitely written testament to the human spirit. I have learned something invaluable in its reading. My hope is that you will also. \n         ', u'\n           \n           Despite a pair of solid 4-star reviews from trusted GR friends, I fully expected to hate this. Any time a memoirist opts to tell her story pseudonymously, my inner skeptic waves a semaphore: "Bullshit alert!" Like, who\'s she hiding from? Can we trust  anything she has to impart?I\'m glad I got past my initial skepticism, as "Anna Lyndsey"\'s Girl in the Dark certainly should not be dismissed. Her account of her descent into darkness (literally), thanks to a chronic, as yet uncurable condition that causes her skin to feel like it\'s being "blasted with a blowtorch" with the presence of most any light sources (from the sun to her laptop display) , is quite a compelling read. It reminds me a great deal of Todd Haynes\' 1995 movie "Safe", where Julianne Moore\'s character is stricken ill by unknown, unseen environmental factors and becomes unable to leave her house. Ms. Lyndsey\'s plight, related in short, loosely connected, somewhat chronological bursts, traces her life from the early onset of the illness (as she tries to navigate her stressful job shaping public policy as a civil servant in England), to trying to maintain a blossoming love relationship with her photographer boyfriend Pete as her condition spirals out of control, to hunkering down in their oftentimes pitch-blackened house with little more than audio books to keep her company, to swathing herself head-to-toe with special clothing and transported (in a tent-like device in the back of her boyfriend\'s car) to many ineffective clinic appointments and alternate therapies (from reiki massage to chelation).This could easily been a somber, one-note mopefest, but the short, surprisingly well-written chapters (with random insights on how she staves off insanity and depression) made this consistently interesting and relatable. I\'m still not quite sure why she chose a pen name to tell her story, but I\'m glad my fears of a lack of veracity were unfounded.\n         ', u'\n           \n           *NetGalley book review*I can not imagine what it must be like to lose your sight. Of course you say, close your eyes silly. But its more than that. To lose it little by little and have light sensitivity problems added on to it... I would make my whole house a dark room. I was so captivated by this story only a few short pages into it and it was an emotional ride never to forget. This is one of the best medically themed memoirs I have read.

As Robert discovers, his rational, well-ordered mind will be forever altered by his obsession for Ginevra, and his destiny will be forever linked to Oxmoon by the skeletons that lurk in the family closet. <br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 For fifty years, from the sinister summer afternoon of 1913 to the 1960s, the Godwin family is sucked into a maelstrom of passion, disorder, madness, and murder. Fortunes rise and fall in this sweeping, compulsive tale, until the Wheel of Fortune finally comes full circle.', u'4339', u'4.11', u'2132', [(u'to-read', 1583), (u'currently-reading', 247), (u'historical-fiction', 82), (u'fiction', 52)], [u'\n           \n           Murder, madness and mayhem - oh my. The Godwins have lived at Oxmoon for generations. The story begins in 1913, and is narrated by Robert the younger (all the first born sons of the first born sons are named Robert). Robert senior struggles to bring the estate back to financial health after it was run into the ground by his mother\'s notorious lover, Owain Bryn-Davies. Robert is raised with distant cousin Ginevra (Ginette) and the two maintain a strong bond of friendship that eventually blossoms into love - at least for Robert although he must wait until he\'s old enough to declare his feelings \u2013 but *something* happens that sends his plans spiraling and Ginette suddenly elopes with another man. The pair eventually meet again years later when Ginette is widowed, but can their love and friendship overcome the horrible secret that caused Ginette to flee Oxmoon in the first place? The story continues with that of Robert\'s younger brother John, the stalwart of the family who always does the "done" thing - that is until the just-barely-widowed John meets the very married and terribly unsuitable (common!) Bronwen and falls head over heels in love. Even when she is free Bronwen is not a suitable wife for John and he marries another heiress instead. Will he make a choice for true happiness or continue doing the "done thing\u201d? The last third of the book carries to the next generation with the conflicts between cousins Christopher (Kester) and Harry. Kester is Robert\'s son and heir to Oxmoon, but John\'s son Harry thinks John should have been the heir and the battle between the two cousins eventually ignites with deadly consequences. The very last section is Hal\'s story (Harry\'s son) as he returns to Oxmoon to try to find out what really happened between the two at their final confrontation on The Worm\'s Head (do Google that and look at the photos - awesome).Of course there\'s a whole lot more to the story than that but I am not into book reports. I found this to be a grand ride taking me from the early 1900s on through the 1960s, and Howatch\'s method of using alternating narratives of the main characters is awesome (PG and Weir you should take lessons from her). I loved seeing the relationship between Robert and Ginette from both perspectives, and I adored John\'s story as he struggles to do the right thing even when his heart is pulled into another direction. As for the stormy love-hate relationship between Kester and Harry - wow, just wow. The very last with Hal I didn\'t care for as much and I almost wished Howatch had left off after Harry\'s story, but she ended up pulling a couple of excellent twists that I was not expecting. One final note and that is the twist on this book, is that the Godwin\'s story parallels that of England\'s Plantagenets - Edward III, Edward The Black Prince, Joan the Fair Maid of Kent, John of Gaunt (yes, there is a Katherine), Richard II, Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and Henry V. For readers who like bit fat meaty sagas with a healthy dose of soap opera angst and anguish this just might be the book for you. 5/5 stars and highly recommended along with her two books that precede this, Penmarric and Cashelmara.\n', u'\n           \n           Ah, how to rate a 1000+ page family saga that attempts to retell 14th century Plantagenet drama as a 20th century story . . . . All this royal eccentric behavior sure seems outrageous compared to Victorian and Edwardian standards!The story is split into sections told by different members of the Godwin family to move it through the generations. We begin with Robert Godwin (one of many), who is our Edwardian Black Prince to Ginette, his Fair Maid of Kent. I especially enjoyed how Howatch creatively gave these characters personalities that suited the historical person they represented but fit into the more modern times and gave a modern twist to historical events. Instead of the kingdom of England, the Godwin\'s are masters of the estate of Oxmoon.Once the story moved to Ginevra\'s point of view, I realized that Howatch also has a skill for creating a real person, who is one person inside and another to each person they encounter. As Ginette herself says, there\'s so much we don\'t know about those who are closest to us. Though the characters talk A LOT about sex, we also see that a marriage can be based on so many other things.John, Robert\'s brother - yes there are also brothers Lionel, Edmund, and Thomas - is our next narrator. He struggles to be upstanding, to "do the done thing", and makes himself miserable in the process. The past creeps up to mess with poor John en force. Lion and Edmund fight in WWI, side by side with their French allies rather than against them like their historical counterparts.You are seeing the pattern now.... Kester is the 20th century, ill-fated and eccentric Richard II. This character is cleverly written to sometimes gain the reader\'s sympathy and at other times make one want to kill him as much as half his family wanted to. Somehow both bold but never the perfect Godwin that he wishes to be, Kester is a mystery wrapped in an enigma, even years after his death.When Harry takes over, the narration and Oxmoon, he and Kester have a battle royal. Through it all, each generation struggles with their desires versus what is expected, scandalous family history, and that sneaky insanity that tries to creep up on each of them.Hal\'s story is the only part I could have done without. In his attempt to solve his family\'s mysteries, Hal becomes repetitive and a little bit of a bore. (Or maybe it was the more modern setting, 1966 and beyond, that I just wasn\'t as interested in.) I did enjoy the final twists and turns, but could have done without several recaps of what I had just read.Overall, a unique take on my dear Plantagenets that had me captivated, made me laugh, and made me look at people a little bit differently. Themes of the Oxmoon estate, "The Blue Danube", and doing the done thing carry this story forth and unite the characters through beautiful prose and realistic characters. "You can\'t divide these unfortunate people neatly into heroes and villains - it\'s simply not that kind of story!" Don\'t be afraid of the number of pages. This novel is worth it.\n         ', u'\n           \n           This novel is a little over a 1000 pages but don\u2019t let that put you off. If you love great English historical fiction this really is the best. I\u2019ve read Cashelmara and Penmarric and loved them but this novel is my favorite. Loosely based on the last of the Plantatgenets, \xa0it begins with a new cast where Cashelmara ends. The very detailed novel concentrates on the Godwin\u2019s beloved family home of Oxmoon in Gower, South Wales and focuses on the class structure of England in the early 1900s. There are six narrations from the 1920s to the 1970s. Ms. Howatch uses this unique style to give the reader multiple views of each character. Just as you have one strong opinion about a character the story shifts and the reader has a deeper view of personalities and perspectives, making the storyline extremely interesting.I nearly abandoned this during the first section which is about the very unlikable Robert Godwin who is the character that the rest of the saga surrounds. Robert appeared to be a boring, full of himself, pathetic creature. Through the novel he still remains peculiar, however, as you get to know him and understand his personality he becomes fascinating, if not likable. Then, there is his cousin who is two years older than him. Robert\u2019s obsession with the sensual Ginevra becomes his downfall as he throws himself into a disastrous marriage with her. The reader captures the real Ginevra, aside from Robert\u2019s viewpoint, in the next narration. The thought provoking story evolves into a dark Gothic tale and takes off at very high speed. The turbulent theme is primarily based on competitive cousins, the burden of guilt, mayhem and madness. At this point my control was taken away from me as the pages seemed to turn themselves and the novel will stay with me for a very long time! \xa0\n', u"\nMore like 4.5 stars.Very clever and detailed 'modern' interpretation of the lives of the English historical figures Edward (AKA The Black Prince), Joan (AKA The Fair Maid of Kent), John of Gaunt, Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V. The cast come alive in this multi-generational saga that encompasses everything from scandal, lust, murder, sodomy, drunkenness, abuse, illegitimacy, jealously, madness and extortion spanning the years 1913 to 1966. I seriously loved how the author wove the historical facts into a riveting story which gave a great psychological and sympathetic insight into the characters. There were no heros or villains just people doing the best they could as the actions of earlier generations echoed down the years.

But despite that possibility, I\'m still giving credit to wiseacre Gabriel McBride for making it happen. If he was real instead of the heroic lead in a romance novel, I\'d send him the bill for pain and suffering on my sinuses.Ms. Ryan writes some of the best banter of her career in this one, and uses that gift for dialog to help string together a story that\'s part Chuck Norris action movie, part whirlwind "will-they-or-won\'t-they?" romance tale, and part spaghetti western. You want gunfights, barroom brawls, cage-fighting women with a penchant for inflicting pain on the unwary, redneck bootleggers, flashbacks to tragic incidents, mysterious bikers, attempted kidnappings and a cute little podunk nowhere town that just about anybody would love to call home?

Unlike her other stories though, there\'s one who stands out above all the rest in this tale, and that\'s the afore-mentioned McBride who manages to perfectly walk that fine tightrope stretched between the extremes of \'hick comic relief\' and \'intelligent male cop\'. McBride is so gosh-darn fun to watch in action, whether he\'s arguing with ex-wife/love interest Alessandra Norris or trading gunfire with an unknown assailant. He\'s Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood rolled into one without becoming a parody or a two-dimensional hunk of corrugated cardboard spouting one-liners in place of honest communication. Heck, I\'m a guy reading a romance novel where he\'s probably going to get the girl and even I can\'t help liking him. That should tell you something.No matter what, if you enjoy mysteries, suspense, action, a bit of sexytime from the romantic leads, and characters who trade verbal jabs as well as they trade gunshots, you\'ll have a ton of fun with Dakota Marshal.

In this highly original book, Glaser shows how writers working in Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish during much of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century were in intense conversation with one another. The marketplace was both the literal locale at which members of these different societies and cultures interacted with one another and a rich subject for representation in their art. It is commonplace to note the influence of Gogol on Russian literature, but Glaser shows him to have been a profound influence on Ukrainian and Yiddish literature as well. And she shows how Gogol must be understood not only within the context of his adopted city of St. Petersburg but also that of his native Ukraine. As Ukrainian and Yiddish literatures developed over this period, they were shaped by their geographical and cultural position on the margins of the Russian Empire. As distinctive as these writers may seem from one another, they are further illuminated by an appreciation of their common relationship to Russia. Glaser\u2019s book paints a far more complicated portrait than scholars have traditionally allowed of Jewish (particularly Yiddish) literature in the context of Eastern European and Russian culture.<br /><br /><br />', u'2', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28404552', u'The Moonstone', u' ', u'\n4012\nWilkie Collins\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222099p5/4012.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222099p2/4012.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4012.Wilkie_Collins\n3.92\n200656\n12230\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u"Wilkie Collins's enthralling story of the cursed diamond stolen from an Indian shrine is the first and probably finest work of detective fiction in the language.<br />The exquisite Moonstone, a diamond that brings bad luck to whoever has it in their possession, is given to Rachel Verinder for her eighteenth birthday. To the dismay of her family, it is stolen from her that very same night. Sergeant Cuff is brought in to investigate and, with the help of Gabriel Betteredge, the family steward, he becomes aware of numerous possibilities: that Rachel herself stole the Moonstone, that her cousin Franklin was the thief, or that her maid Rosanna took it.

The Moonstone is the first\u2014certainly the first fully-formed\u2014detective novel, and it contains within that great \u201cfirst\u201d a number of little \u201cfirsts\u201d: the first English country house mystery featuring a large guest list of suspects, the first crew of bumbling local policemen mucking about in the evidence, the first detective genius distinguished by an unlikely hobby, the first small, suggestive physical clue (a smear on the bottom of a newly-painted door), the first effective \u201cred herrings\u201d (I counted at least two), the first attempt at a precise reenactment of the crime at its original scene, and the first pursuit of a disguised criminal through the streets of a major city.But it is the plot, which uses all these \u201cfirsts\u201d to great advantage, that both astonishes and pleases the reader. The Moonstone is at least three times the length of the average detective novel, and yet it sustains interest and maintains credibility throughout its many twists. turns, and asides. Its plot reminds me of the melody line of Bellini's \u201cCasta Diva,\u201d which strikes the ear as a thing of incomparable elegance, but never calls to mind\u2014except upon later reflection\u2014either its own extraordinary length or the expert craftsmanship such seamless length requires. Also impressive is Collins' sympathetic depiction of the English servant class. Steward and Butler Gabriel Betteredge is a marvelous comic character, memorable for his daily readings of Robinson Crusoe, which he reveres as a source of divination and practical guidance. But Betteredge is also the essentially reliable narrator of half the novel, and, as we learn of the events on the Verinder estate through his eyes and ears, we grow to love and trust him as a good man and an intelligent observer. Also noteworthy is Collins' presentation of Roseanna, the servant girl with a deformed shoulder and a criminal past. Collins treats her with dignity, neither as a comic grotesque nor as an object of simple pity, but as fully human person with a unique, blighted destiny.But perhaps my favorite thing about the book is Collins' use of \u201cThe Moonstone\u201d itself, that great diamond snatched from a Hindu shrine by the villainous Colonel Herncastle during the Siege of Seringapatam\u2014the 1799 climax to the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War which served to institutionalize English theft under the banner of the British East India Company. It is the second theft of this gem from the Verinder estate that precipitates the events of the novel, but memory of the original crime\u2014and its curse\u2014is never far from the reader, for the Brahmins who wish to return \u201cThe Moonstone\u201d to the shrine of Chandra are never far away. At first these shadowy figures appear to be exotic villians, but Collins eventually shows us that the real criminals\u2014both past and present\u2014are the \u201crespectable\u201d English, and he grants his Hindu priests a moving coda. Sure, the ending of the novel is romantic, and exotic. But it is dignified and respectful of other cultures too.The real reason, however, that you should read The Moonstone is that it endures, after all these years, as a diverting and absorbing entertainment. The first detective novel is still as readable as if it were published today.\n         ", u'\n\nThe Moonstone was published in 1868 and is considered by most people to be the first detective novel. Given the novels place in the history of the genre, that alone should put this book on most people\'s reading lists. To sweeten the pot, the plot is compelling, the last hundred pages I couldn\'t have put the book down for anything. I was caught up in the case and wanted to find out the why and the who in the mysterious circumstances surrounding the MOONSTONE.The novel is narrated by several different people. My favorite was Gabriel Betteredge, the head servant at the Verinder house, who becomes a reluctant Watson for Detective Cuff during the investigation. He is a man convinced in the spiritual guidance of Robinson Crusoe and believes that any disruption in his life can be explained by reading and interpreting passages from his dogeared copy of Defoe\'s classic. "In this anxious frame of mind, other men might have ended by working themselves up into a fever; I ended in a different way. I lit my pipe, and took a turn at Robinson Crusoe."\nBetteredge is a man of his age and his views on women I found so ridiculous as to actually laugh out loud. "It is a maxim of mine that men (being superior creatures) are bound to improve women-if they can. When a woman wants me to do anything I always insist on knowing why. The oftener you make them rummage their won minds for a reason, the more manageable you will find them in all the relations of life. It isn\'t their fault (poor wretches!) that they act first, and think afterwards; it\'s the fault of the fools who humour them."Despite his archaic views, Betteredge proves to be a good assistant to the enigmatic Sergeant Cuff. Cuff\'s eyes had such intensity, "looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself." Wilkie Collins based his character Sergeant Cuff on a real celebrated Victorian Detective Inspector Jack Whicher. \nSergeant Cuff is summoned from London to investigate the disappearance of the Moonstone, and despite the reluctance of the household to help him in his investigations, he does come up with a theory (kept from us) that proves in the final pages of the book that he is worthy of his reputation. Cuff is as equally interested in the rose gardens (he has strong opinions) as he is in the crime he is investigating. "grass walkways never gravel" Collins does a great job putting flesh on the bones of the characters. We learn more about every major character than is necessary for the advancement of the plot. By the end of the novel I had the feeling that I was not only closing the cover on a great book, but also leaving behind some dear friends. Another narrator, that I was not fond of, in fact, she made my skin crawl is Drusilla Clack. A cousin of the family, Drusilla, with her tendency to eavesdrop and make herself in all ways intrusive on her family and "friends" is a born again christian. The novel is set in 1848 and the term born again was not in use until much later, but she fits the profile. She was determined to save everyone and carried about her person tracts of her hero Miss Jane Ann Stamper. Once she has invaded a house she would leave tracts scattered about in places where people would eventually find them, and hopefully receive the edification that Drusilla felt they needed. \nShe seemed like this on first appearances.\nBut like Drusilla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer she would pounce on people, not for blood, but for a chance to save their immortal souls. As I have mentioned, all the characters are well developed and Drusilla is no exception. She is a person, that after a previous encounter, you would go to great lengths to keep her from buttonholing you again. This book delivers. You will not be disappointed. If I read it again I will put on a kettle of good English tea, light some candles, and tuck myself into an armchair, suspending myself as well as I can back into a Victorian age. I had such a great time I will certainly be reading more Wilkie Collins. "You are welcome to be as merry as you please over everything else I have written. But when I write of Robinson Crusoe, by the Lord it\'s serious-and I request you to take it accordingly!" \n \n', u'\n           \n           4.5 stars, rounding up, for this 1868 Victorian-era mystery, often considered the first English-language detective novel. Wilkie Collins spins a literary web that starts out slowly but then inexorably pulls you in; I finished the last half of the book in one extended readathon. He has a gift for writing as vastly different characters, who each take a turn telling or writing their part of the story, and a droll, sometimes very sarcastic sense of humor.In 1799 a British soldier steals a large yellow diamond from a Hindu statute in India, ruthlessly killing three Indian men protecting the statue, and earning himself a curse from one of them in the process. He gets a bad reputation as a result and is shunned by his extended family in England. So when he dies, he leaves the Moonstone to his niece Rachel (whose mother refused to receive him as a guest in her home), knowing he\'s leaving her not only a 30,000 pound fortune in the jewel, but also a load of potential trouble: there\'s not just the amorphous curse, but three Indian men who have been following the owners of the Moonstone for years and are determined to steal it back, one way or another.Rachel\'s relative Franklin Blake is entrusted with bringing her the diamond for her 18th birthday, and falls in love with her as he gets to know her over several days. The Indians are lurking, looking for their chance to grab their gem. Rachel wears the Moonstone at a dinner party the night of her birthday, puts the jewel in a drawer in her bedroom ... and the next morning it\'s gone. The odd thing is, it looks like an inside job. The bumbling local police are of little help, and even the renowned outside detective, the estimable Sergeant Cuff, is unable to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion, though part of the problem is that several people aren\'t cooperating with him.Wilkie Collins doesn\'t try all that hard to hide the villain in the tale, but the "how" is fascinatingly revealed over the last half of the book. I don\'t think Wilkie was particularly interested in giving readers all of the clues; this isn\'t really a mystery that is supposed to be solved by readers before the big reveal, in my opinion (the final reveal of exactly what went down that fateful night pretty much comes out of left field, though there are a few clues in the story). He\'s more interested in telling an exciting story, and he pulls just about everything into the mix: a massive jewel, star-crossed love, people hiding things for their own reasons, a servant with a highly suspicious past, dangerous quicksand, and a loyal servant with an amusing and rather touching devotion to Robinson Crusoe, which he treats as a sort of Bible. Better him than Rachel\'s cousin Drusilla Clack, an annoying Christian evangelist given to preaching and leaving tracts with titles like "Satan in the Hair Brush" around people\'s homes!This proto-detective novel does get a little slow at times (Victorian authors typically weren\'t in a hurry to tell their stories), but once the storyline really started moving along in the second half I thought it was a great read. Plus points for handling the Indian subplot in a manner that\'s unusually sensitive for books written in the Victorian age.\n         ', u'\n           \n           The following is a recently found letter written by the English author Charles Dickens to his friend Wilkie Collins concerning the latter\u2019s newly released 1868 novel The Moonstone:Charles Dickens11 Gad\u2019s Hill PlaceHingham, KentEnglandNovember 13, 1868Dear Wilkie, I am now pressing my pen against this paper to congratulate you on the success of your excellent new novel, The Moonstone. I have just completed reading it and I would like to present you with my opinion that this was, as they say, a true \u201cpage turner\u201d in every sense of the word. I am also taking the liberty to take this compliment a step further by stating that this is one of the finest mystery novels of all time.  I must confess that I have never actually read a book such as this that captures the sensation of a mysterious theft and a thorough investigation that follows it. It was a fascinating read throughout as the solution to the mystery was also entirely above my suspicion. I also thoroughly enjoyed the use of multi-narration where the reader obtains various different viewpoints during the inquiry concerning the loss of the Indian diamond. I believe that this novel, The Moonstone, has successfully maintained the same exceptional level of quality as your masterpiece, The Woman in White, and it ranks among the top tiers of the written pages from our fellow countrymen. I have not the shadow of a doubt that this book will continue to enthrall readers for centuries to come. The Moonstone is a best-seller at the local bookseller here in Kent and my excitement for your continued success is immense. Well done, my dear friend Wilkie. We shall celebrate this achievement over a glass of Cognac. Best wishes and I look forward to reading your future works.Your friend always,Charles Dickens\n', u'\n           \n           The problem with mysteries \u2013 for me, anyway, is that I don\'t care who did it. Which is a drawback. I just think well, it\'s one of those characters the author has given a name to, it won\'t be the fourth man back on the upper deck of the omnibus mentioned briefly on page 211. It will be someone with a name. And further, it will be someone who you don\'t think it will be, because that\'s the whole point. You don\'t think it\'s going to be that person so it\'s a surprise. So, if it turns out to be the not-obvious person (how could the little spinster with the gammy foot batter the ten foot Guardsman to death and scale the west wall on the fateful night? Well, she was on Victorian crack is how) I say \u2013 wow, how obvious. She was really not obviously the murderer, so she was obviously the murderer. However, I really liked Wilkie\'s novels  The Woman in White and No Name, so I read this. In a modern detective tale, you have your detective, and there is a detective in this one, but he only occupies a short part of the story, he quickly retires to grow roses, literally, that\'s not a euphemism for some kind of rent boy scandal, so the rest of the story is made up by narratives from five or six main characters.Now comes the dance of the seven veils.Because if two narrators had been given their voice, the whole novel would have been over in 50 pages. You get the longwinded thoughts of all the people who DON\'T know what actually happened. By page 350, after being mumbled at, prevaricated over, and digressed to for what seemed days, NAY, weeks, by Wilkie Collins\' five narrators, all of whom suffer from amusing psychological tics and endearing human flaws, or was it the other way round, and all of whom could have summarised their tales onto two pages of foolscap, I was ready to shrink myself to the size of a capital R (pronounced "aargh") and insert myself into this novel Fantastic Voyage-style and grab a passing amateur sleuth and confess loudly I STOLE YOUR DAMNED MOONSTONE, ARREST ME, AND THERE\'S AN END OF IT!(Memo - write future review of Victorian novel as if invested into it Fantastic Voyage-style. Should be hilarious.)Actually, there is a point to all this 430 pages of Moonstone. The whole plot, and this, strangely enough, is not a spoiler, hangs on the attempt of one guy to give up smoking. So The Moonstone is a very elaborate warning that going cold turkey is a bad idea, you must use the patches.The Moonstone is often cited as the earliest medical warning story \u2013 later examples are Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde, which concerns self-medication and its dangers, and Henry James\' Daisy Miller, which explains to tourists that they must get all their vaccinations. The genre is still thriving - the recent movie Bad Lieutenant \u2013 Port of New Orleans is all about inappropriate methods of combating severe back pain.In the end I thought this was the Monkees instead of The Beatles, Pleasant Valley Sunday instead of Tomorrow Never Knows. \n'], 0]!!!![u'12017233', u'Light in the Evening', u' ', u'\n190465\nLaJoyce Martin\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/190465.LaJoyce_Martin\n4.60\n177\n5\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'4', u'5.00', u'3', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28435332', u'Kampen om Jerntronen (En sang om is og ild #1, del 2)', u'609', u'\n346732\nGeorge R.R.

O si vince o si muore"\nPrima di avventurarmi con il secondo libro mi sono guardata la prima stagione della serie in modo da avere pi\xf9 chiari luoghi e personaggi.Non potevo fare scelta migliore, veramente. Avr\xf2 perso l\'effetto sorpresa ecc ma almeno mi sono goduta questo libro molto pi\xf9 del precedente.I personaggi principali e la loro storia ora mi sono molto pi\xf9 chiari e infatti sono riuscita a seguire molto bene i vari capitoli.Ovviamente ci sono capitoli che ho trovato a gusto personale pi\xf9 noisi degli altri. Prima di tutto penso debba piacere il genere, altrimenti non si va da nessuna parte.Non lo considero assolutamente un libro "leggero", almeno per me, lo trovo invece piuttosto da seguire perch\xe8 alla minima distrazione su quel particolare dettaglio si pu\xf2 successivamente andare del tutto fuori strada.Questo a me \xe8 capitato durante i capitoli che sono strettamente collegati alla guerra o comunque dedicati a varie successioni, strategie e battaglie.Nello specifico sto parlando di quelli di Catelyn e in parte quelli su Tyrion. I capitoli poi che ho trovato in assoluto pi\xf9 pesanti sono quelli di Bran, che invece nel primo non mi dispiacevano.I miei preferiti restano quelli di Daenerys che servono per distaccare da tutti gli altri. La sua storia e il suo modo di vedere e vivere le cose...Il finale poi dedicato a lei l\'ho trovato una bomba, rispetto a come si conclude con gli altri personaggi ho trovato il suo finale nettamente superiore e nettamente pi\xf9 interessante ed eccitante.Il bello di questi libri \xe8 che non seguono una trama specifica, si vive giorno per giorno la vita di queste persone, e su questo libro per alcuni \xe8 una vera e propria lotta per la sopravvivenza.In questo, tra l\'altro, c\'\xe8 molta pi\xf9 azione e tensioni e quindi si crea anche maggiore interesse, dalla seconda met\xe0 soprattutto. Si conosce un lato nuovo dei nostri protagonisti.E\' sempre curioso scoprire come pensano queste persone ed \xe8 una vera a propria avventura non sapere dove si andr\xe0 a finire o chi ci lascer\xe0 o quali altri personaggi verranno introdotti.Neppure sul retro si trova una vera a propria trama del singolo libro, perch\xe8 in definitiva non c\'\xe8, se non una molto generale come introduzione a tutto, che \xe8 infatti quella che troviamo scritta.Non parlo poi del mondo creato che \xe8 enorme, anche se vengono citati sempre gli stessi posti \xe8 bellissimo vedere sulla mappa quanti altri nomi ci siano.Sto iniziando ad entrare nell\'ottica di questa serie, e anche se il genere non \xe8 proprio il mio preferito, mi sta suscitando curiosit\xe0 sapere come si proseguir\xe0 con la storia!____________Before starting with the second book, I watched first the first season of the series to have a clear idea of places and people.I couldn\'t have done better choice, seriously. Maybe I lost the surprise etc but at least I enjoyed the second book a lot more than the previous one.The main characters and their stories are clearer in my head and in fact I was able to follow pretty well all the chapters.Obviously there are some chapters that I personally think are more boring than others. I think that first of all you have to like the genre or we\'re going nowhere.I don\'t consider these books a "light read" at all, al least for me, I found them instead a read that has to be followed in every detail because the very little distraction makes you completely confused.This happened to me while I was reading the chapters strictly related to the war or various successions, strategies and battles.I will say in the specific the ones of Catelyn and a part of the ones of Tyrion.The chapters that I found very heavy were Bran\'s, that I liked instead in the first book.Daenerys\' are still my favorites, they are the best to cut a little between all the others. Her story and her way to view things...The finale then, completely dedicated to her was a bomb, compared to the other characters\' finales, this one was on the next level and way more interesting and exciting.The thing that I like about these books is that they don\'t follow a specific plot, we live day per day the life of these people, and for some of them in this book is a total fight to survive.In this one there\'re more action and tensions, making the book more interesting, after the second half especially. We explore a new side of our characters.It\'s always curious to learn how these people think and it\'s a true adventure not knowing what will happen, or who will leave us or who we\'ll meet next.Not even in the back we find a true summary of the single book, because in fact, there isn\'t one. There\'s only a very general introduction as an introduction of what it\'s written.And the world that was created is huge, even if are written that same main places, it\'s so cool to read all those names on the map and discover how many more places there are.I think I\'m starting getting into the series, even if it\'s not at all the genre I read on a daily base, it has the power to create that curiosity where I want to know what happens next!\n         ', u'\n           \n           Und es muss gleich weiter gehen!

O Tyrion \xe9 o m\xe1ximo e j\xe1 me fez rir a s\xe9rio (passe a contradi\xe7\xe3o) com algumas das suas "tyradas" (os di\xe1logos com as tribos das montanhas s\xe3o imperd\xedveis). E tamb\xe9m tenho um fraquinho pelo Jon e pelo seu lobo, e ainda pela Arya.Para ser mais ao meu gosto, falta a esta narrativa (por enquanto, pois n\xe3o sei mesmo o que se vai seguir) algum romance a s\xe9rio. Adorava que o Tyrion se apaixonasse, mas contentar-me-ei com qualquer tipo de romance!E agora, rumo a territ\xf3rio inexplorado - que \xe9 como quem diz o 3\xba volume...This second part of the first book met my expectations, considering my opinion on the first part. It\'s funny how I was sometimes hanging from what was happening, like I hadn\'t seen the tv series (and I really didn\'t remembre some of the scenes).I warmed up to a few characters and I\'m always waiting to read their chapters. Tyrion is a blast and he can make me laugh out loud (the dialogues with the mountain tribes are a gem). I also have a soft spot for Jon and his wolf and for Arya as well.To better suit my taste, this story lacks some real romance. I would love to see Tyrion fall in love, but I would settle for any kind of romance!\n'], 0]!!!![u'17108153', u'Professor Bedier Und Die Tagebucher Deutscher Soldaten', u'48', u'\n3103080\nKarl Larsen\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3103080.Karl_Larsen\n3.75\n4\n2\n', u'1915', u'1', u'1', u'Walter de Gruyter', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29373978', u'Totalitarian Capitalism and Beyond', u'248', u'\n6803271\nGeorge Liodakis\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6803271.George_Liodakis\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'2', u'24', u'Routledge', u"Anchored in contemporary debates on capitalism and political economy, this study reconsiders the major trends which are currently shaping a new stage of capitalism.

But this fascinating nonconformist, praised as a hero or criticized as a heretic throughout history, was first and foremost a man searching for God. This new biography by leading Reformation scholar Herman Selderhuis digs deep into the heart and mind of Luther, following him on his spiritual journey and revealing the many facets of his powerful personality, from loving husband and father, to serious monk, to feared opponent, to compelling preacher and writer. Selderhuis uses Luther's own words to help us see him as a man of flesh and blood, full of faith and full of faults, with a deep longing to live for God.", u'134', u'4.28', u'18', [(u'to-read', 102)], [u'\n           \n           When I read biographies, I usually end up highlighting four or five, maybe half a dozen passages\u2014some of these because of interesting ideas, and sometimes because I\u2019m noting an unsupported judgment that weakens the overall point the writer is making.It\u2019s rare that I mark more than a dozen passages, but when I finished this biography of Martin Luther and went back to count up the highlights, I discovered more than twenty\u2014and all of them marking sections woth rereading.This is one of those rarities, a biography written by a scholar clearly thoroughly engaged with the time period as well as the subject, but written so lucidly that the book can be enjoyed by academics as well as the casual reader such as myself.From his first appearance on the European scholastic stage in the early 1500s, Luther inspired a firestorm of writing about him and his ideas, a storm which has scarcely abated in the half-millennium since. Selderhuis steers with style and expertise through all these shoals\u2014whether vilifying or hagiographic\u2014as he presents the man through his own words as much as possible. Back in my own grad school days, I struggled through Luther\u2019s words in Reformation-era German, and I recognized many of these passages.Selderhuis places Luther within the context of his era, initially furnishing an understanding of life in Luther\u2019s Germany and setting it against the religious issues of that time. Without passing judgment on the Roman Catholic Church of the period (and reminding the reader that Luther began his famous career determined to be a good monk, which he was for half his life), Selderhuis shows how Luther evolved from organizer to reformer. I appreciated the care the author took in explaining the scholastic and theological pursuits of the day, such as setting up debates\u2014which the famous 95 Theses was intended to be. Luther did not dramatically break with the Church when he proposed the theses. He wanted debate, clarification, and correction, and Selderhuis takes us through every step of Luther\u2019s thought processes as he dealt with his initial religious fears, then read the Bible for himself, and then encountered Erasmus\u2019s Greek translation, which was a thunderbolt to Luther.Selderhuis then takes the reader step by step through the evolution of Luther\u2019s thought as he strives to define Christian faith through Biblical text, and separate it from centuries of traditional and ritual accretion that, he posited, had nothing to do with Christ\u2019s message. So we read about Luther making his way through one crisis to another, harrowed by spiritual, political, medical, and later, social and familial problems\u2014his own personality, as he often recognized, getting in his way, especially later in life. It\u2019s clear from this record that Luther both relished life and yet was tormented by what we can now recognize as the symptoms of Meniere\u2019s disease, and probably IBS as well\u2014much exacerbated not only by the diet of those times, but the horrible \u201ccures\u201d\u2014most of which involved some form of dung. When he called himself, as he frequently did, a bag of maggots, that might not have been very far from the truth.Pain likely made Luther irascible, and drove him to see Satan and devils everywhere, including, in his later years, not only his enemies but old friends with whom he disagreed. Seiderhuis does not neglect the less savory side of Luther, such as his venomous writings about Turks and especially Jews. The latter is particularly unfortunate, as we know how those words were used by certain Germans in the last century, and yet Luther\u2014presented with the horrific outcome\u2014might have regretted his heat, for we also see evidence of his dislike of violence. He not only found the noble art of hunting dispiriting, as he felt sorrow for the innocent animals, but he dreaded violence being used to enforce religious laws and views, as inevitably happened\u2014all this while living in expectation of being dragged to the stake by either pope or emperor.Seiderhuis does not neglect the important figures in Luther\u2019s life, and takes the time to give them their voices, not excluding Luther\u2019s wife Kathe, who too frequently has been judged as a shrew because of complaining letters from the many Luther invited to his home. It was she who had to collect rents, in order to pay for a household that not only included the many Luther invited to reside with them, but seventeen children\u2014her own six, and the eleven belonging to Luther\u2019s siblings who died young. She organized his bachelor pad into a home, and established kitchen gardens and milk animals, as Luther--raised as a monk--never thought about money. He shared everything he had, but it fell to her to figure out how to do it.Above all, this is a record of Luther\u2019s spiritual evolution, and the beginning of the reformation church branches, as he and his contemporaries debated crucial concepts, and tried to find ways to translate those into everyday life, as well as in new forms of worship. Political writers often find it convenient to overlook the spiritual side of Luther, claiming political and social expedience on every side (particularly in reference to the Peasants\u2019 War, and other imperial maneuverings), but Seiderhuis demonstrates that this was an age of faith. As evidenced by the hundreds, even thousands, who traveled at great hardship just to lay eyes on Luther, or to hear him preach. In spite of his many illnesses, Luther was an indefatigable worker, writing many books, and sometimes as much as forty letters in a day, but Seiderhuis shows\u2014often with illustrations from the Cranachs, who lived nearby\u2014how Luther took time in the evenings to be with his family, and how important music was to him. So, in the end, we see the man as well as the reformer and catalyst for change.The bibliography at the end is every bit as formidable as one could expect in such a careful, scholarly work, and the prose is clear, humane, vivid, and engaging.Copy provided by NetGalley\n', u'\n           \n           Despite the fact that religion itself has no real place in my own day to day life, theology has always been a subject that fascinates me. Why do people believe what they do? And how?In university I did a bit of work on the reformation in England and again, the subject matter just grabbed me. Religion has shaped countries, it still does.So I jumped at the opportunity to read this book on Martin Luther, a figurehead of the reformation across Europe. A reluctant figurehead at first, as I discovered reading this book, and not always a pleasant man.The author takes the reader on a very matter-a-fact journey through Martin Luther\u2019s life. He shows Luther as a committed monk, a passionate and stubborn reformer, a respected theologist, a loving father, but also touches on his difficult character and his flaws, his anti-semitism and his self-righteousness.The biographical parts are interspersed with quotes and letters from Martin Luther himself. The author speculates little, preferring to lean on fact, and although it can sometimes make the text a little dry, it also gives it integrity. Sometimes it does jump around in time and it is not always clear why the author has chosen to write this biography that way.Overall, having read this biography I feel I have gained an understanding of a turbulent time I did not quite have before. I am certainly a little wiser.*Read as an ARC courtesy of the publisher via NetGalley*\n         ', u'\n           \n           First sentence from the introduction: Luther was a problem. Certainly for the pope and the emperor, but often he was also a problem for his fellow reformers. Prone to outbursts of rage and coarse language, Luther was frequently stubborn and undiplomatic, even with allies. First sentence from chapter one: God, the Devil, and death were everyday topics in the world into which Martin Luther was born. As a child, Luther learned that God was a Judge more righteous than merciful. The Devil was out to snatch your soul and turn women into witches. Death was not the end of life, Luther was taught, but instead it was the moment you appear before God and enter purgatory. With these dour lessons firmly in his head, is it any surprise that years later Luther would say that every mention of God was \u201cas a clap of thunder in [his] heart\u201d? The god that Martin Luther was told to believe in as a child was a god who signaled his righteousness chiefly through punishment.Premise/plot: Herman Selderhuis has written a spiritual biography of Martin Luther. He balances writing about Martin Luther\'s life with letting Martin Luther tell his own story by sharing quotes from his books, letters, sermons, pamphlets, etc. Even if you\'ve read half a dozen books on Martin Luther in the past, I\'d invite you to read this newly published biography. Selderhuis\' narrative style is compelling.My thoughts: I loved this book. I have read a handful of books on Martin Luther. Perhaps I should amend that to read, I\'ve struggled my way through a handful of books on Martin Luther. I\'ve almost always found them dull, intimidating, repetitive, or simplistic. Perhaps that isn\'t fair. Perhaps a fairer description would be not quite ideal in terms of reader appeal or approachability.I loved Selderhuis\' biography because it was packed with information, with detail, but the presentation was such that everything fit together and created a big picture context. It included plenty of information--some of it new to me--in a fascinating narrative. Nothing was dumbed down or made to be concise. The book was not yet another basic outline of his life. There\'s a passage in Ezekiel that I think applies here.Ezekiel 37:1-10 reads,"The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. And he said to me, \u201cSon of man, can these bones live?\u201d And I answered, \u201cO Lord God, you know.\u201d Then he said to me, \u201cProphesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.\u201dSo I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, \u201cProphesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.\u201d So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army." Other biographers have given readers the dry bones of Martin Luther. But it is Selderhuis\' biography that has given Martin Luther flesh and skin in my opinion. I loved LEARNING. There were so many things I did NOT know about Luther even though I\'ve read up on him. For example, did you know that Martin Luther once promised his wife fifty guilders if she would read the Bible cover to cover during the period of early October to Easter? (She was SUPER busy being a mom and wife) Selderhuis writes, "Apparently, K\xe4the accepted this arrangement because on October 28, Luther mentioned to a friend, \u201cShe is taking this seriously, because she has already reached Deuteronomy.\u201d I was aware of Martin Luther\'s many stomach ailments. But I was NOT aware of the ringing in his ears. I found out I have something else in common with him!OR did you know that on his deathbed Martin Luther kept quoting Psalm 31:6?Favorite Selderhuis quotes:The Middle Ages may not have been as dark as they have often been portrayed, but from a spiritual perspective, the world in which young Martin Luther grew up was more like a haunted house than a playground. Whoever reads the Bible must be very careful not to wander, Luther insisted. One can expand on the Scriptures, but this should never be directed by feeling. Instead, one must allow the Bible to lead back to the source, that is, to the cross of Christ.Luther did not have an agenda, and he did not have a system of theology. He had a thesis: that God gives grace and does not require merit. The consequences of that thesis were so enormous that they ultimately led to a different Europe. In a sense, October 31, 1517, could be called the birthday of a new world, a world in which life looked different in every context for those who followed Luther\u2019s lead. A society that was based on the conviction that people have to restore their relationship with God changed radically when a new foundational conviction emerged: that God in Christ accomplished everything. The Psalms for him were the key to a life with God. Those who want to obey the first commandment can do that best, Luther believed, by reading through the Psalms, to learn them and to pray them. Despite the constant medical issues, Luther was able to accomplish much work. In 1521, he was sick for seven months but still published thirty treatises, wrote a hundred letters, and preached seventy times. In 1530, he was sick for ten months but produced thirty treatises, one hundred seventy letters, and sixty sermons. In 1536, he was ill for eight months and produced ten treatises, ninety letters, and fifty sermons. In 1545, again sick for ten months, he nevertheless produced thirteen treatises, eighty letters, and thirty-five sermons.Favorite Luther quotes:This letter [Romans] is the most important chapter in the New Testament and is the purist gospel. It would be worth a Christian\u2019s effort not only to memorize this letter word for word but also to work with it on a daily basis like daily bread for the soul. One can never read or reflect on it too often or too thoroughly. The more frequently you engage yourself with this letter, the more valuable and appetizing it becomes.We are doing our best to translate the Prophets into German. God, what a huge and tiring task this is to force the Hebrew writers to speak German. They do not want to abandon their Hebrew singularity to follow the barbarian German.From a book you will never learn to pray well. You can read in it and receive instruction how and in what way you should pray. And you can let it motivate you to pray, but the prayer should come from the heart, without all the words that have already been written, and you should use words that your heart desires\u201cThe letter to the Galatians is my little letter, and I am married to it. It is my K\xe4the von Bora.\u201dEvery preacher must be so sure and should be so convinced that he has and that he preaches the Word of God that he would be willing to die for it, specifically because preaching concerns life.\n', u'\n           \n           Herman Selderhuis, professor of church history at the Theological University Apeldoorn needs little introduction. His book, John Calvin: A Pilgrim\u2019s Life was warmly received by many as he unpacked the Reformer\u2019s life and legacy.Now the author makes his contribution to a growing list of books with Martin Luther: A Spiritual Biography. As we celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, Selderhuis\u2019s work is a fitting tribute to Luther and the many men and women who made a contribution in the sixteenth century.Selderhuis examines ten movements in Luther\u2019s life including Child, Student, Monk, Exegete, Theologian, Architect, Reformer, Father, Professor, and Prophet. Each movement is an opportunity for the author to present historical details and relay the massive contribution that Luther made.The author carefully traces the spiritual history of Luther \u2013 from an unconverted monk who struggled with God and even hated him to a man who passionately embraced the doctrines of grace. Selderhuis does not gloss over the negative details of Luther\u2019s life. Luther\u2019s brashness and vulgarity are explored as well as some of Luther\u2019s racist proclivities.Luther: A Spiritual Biography is an illuminating look at a man whose influence continues to captivate and inspire people around the world. It beautifully complements classic works such as Bainton\u2019s, Here I Stand and should receive a wide reading.I received this book free from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review.\n         ', u'\n           \n           An excellent book. Did a great job in humanising Luther and dispelling many myths.

But it started to really fall flat. The plot and the writing was the only good aspect of this story! The characters however were just ugh. I personally couldn\'t \'bond\' with the MC in the slightest. Though the author did a good job of not immediately making him stupid overpowered, and didn\'t give him the annoying "knight in shining armor" complex. One of the problems that I have is that he really didn\'t grow , when it came to skill progression, when I thought he obviously should have. For example when he went to the Umbra universe, and gunned down dozens of mobs, and didn\'t gain a single skill advance. And here\'s a question, how do people actually level up? At 80% of completion of the book, and Tane is STILL level two?! Really?! Especially when he\'s personally killed dozens of mobs and elite warriors! And a warning to future readers, there is a LOT of exposition in this book. So much so, that I started \'skimming\' almost entire chapters just to get to the point. I can honestly say , that I have no interest in this as a series. \n         ', u"\nSpace FantasyEveryone will compare this to star wars, but that's any sci-fi with fantasy elements.

Ariel must write a proposal for a controversial and expensive restoration project: convert an abandoned flour mill, currently used as shelter by homeless people, into a museum. When a dead body is found stuffed into a grain chute, Chloe's attention turns from milling to murder.<br /><br />Back in Milwaukee, Chloe's love interest Roelke has been slammed with the news that a fellow officer was shot and killed while on duty. Sifting through clues from both past and present, Chloe and Roelke discover dangerous secrets that put their lives--and their trust in each other--at risk.", u'405', u'4.05', u'196', [(u'to-read', 154)], [u'\n           \n           Dollycas\u2019s ThoughtsWow, this was such a fascinating read I feel as if I devoured it.What seems as a ordinary date turns Chloe\u2019s and Roelke\u2019s lives and relationship inside out and upside down. They attend the wedding of one a Roelke\u2019s cop buddies and Chloe just feels like she doesn\u2019t fit in. She takes off the next day to help a friend in Minneapolis questioning her whole relationship with Roelke. Then Roelke gets a phone call telling him his friend and former partner was shot and killed while on duty. He throws himself into the investigation and keeps at it even when he is told to back off. Chloe barely gets into Minneapolis and she gets wrapped up in a murder investigation herself. She really could use Roelke\u2019s help but after the death of his friend he has basically shut her out of his life. It seems \u201cdeceit\u201d is everywhere.Ernst intricately meshes these stories together along with a story from the past that drew me right in. It was not only the murder mysteries that captivated me but the secrets of our main characters as well. We really get to know more about Roelke and Chloe has to face the reality of being in love with a police officer. The story from the past gives us a look back at immigrants that had come to the area in hopes of a better life. The main story lines also look at the homeless and what they endure. She also shines a light on domestic violence.The main part of the story takes place in the early 1980\u2019s so there are no cell phones or internet which adds its own dynamic to the story. Research and crime investigation is done with old fashioned footwork and checking out books and written documents. Police officers don\u2019t have radios hooked to their collars and need to check in via call stations while they are out \u201cwalking their beat\u201d and landlines are the way to get in touch with your family and friends, no texting, emails or quick calls. Cases are not solved quickly as all the investigative technology we now take for granted has even been invented yet. The research Chloe is helping with is also done with document research and stories that have been told and retold over the years.I think this is the best book so far in this series. The characters continue to grow and evolve and the settings were interesting and the topics are still relevant today as the United States looks at immigration reform and the plight of the homeless is still a major problem today. Domestic violence has been around forever and we see that in that story here as well. Ernst presents all topics in a fictional way that while entertaining to read also makes you think. We learn a little history along the way too.This definitely deserves more than 5 stars!\n', u'\n           \n           Tradition Of Deceit by Kathleen Ernst is a good mystery suspense. In fact, there are two murders that need to be solved. Good think there are two people to get the jobs done, Chloe Ellefson and Roelke McKenna. The two are in a relationship and they have a long history together.Chloe is in Minneapolis to help a friend turn an abandoned flour mill into a museum. She knows a little bit about museums, since she is a curator. Currently the mill is a homeless shelter. A dead body is found in a grain chute and thus begins Chloe\u2019s search for a killer.While Chloe is off in Minneapolis, Roelke is in Milwaukee dealing with his own mystery. A fellow officer and old friend has been shot and killed. He must find the killer and the reason behind the murder. Could the two murders be related, even though they are miles apart? Chloe and Roelke will have their hands full figuring it all out. There are many characters in this book, so many so that there is a Cast Of Characters included in the beginning of the book. This is very helpful in keeping track of all the different people. This is the first book that I have read in the series (but it is book five in Chloe Ellefson Mystery Series) so I was not familiar with anyone. The mysteries are carried on throughout the entire book and there are enough twists and turns that I was kept guessing the entire time. The writing style flows smoothly and this was an easy read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great mystery suspense. I would recommend reading the series in order because I have a feeling the characters continue to grow throughout the series. I plan on picking up the first book soon.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a honest review. I would like thank NetGalley and Midnight Ink for the opportunity to read this book.\n', u"\n           \n           I practically inhaled this book which continues the saga of Chloe and Roelke by having them solve two different murders in two cities, Minneapolis and Milwaukee, at the same time. The actual distance between the two is mirrored by a crisis in their relationship. You learn a lot more about Roelke in this book and, boy, does he have a lot of baggage.The mysteries are smart and have intriguing connections despite the distance and the very different situations (one, the murder of Roelke's old friend and former partner, Rick, in Milwaukee; the other, the murder of an esteemed professor of public history who was supervising the dissertation of Chloe's friend, Ariel). Of course, there are fascinating historical tidbits thrown in there, particularly involving the historic culture of Minneapolis's grain mills and Milwaukee's immigrant cultures. Chloe's own rural museum gets a bit of play in here along with some mouthwatering food mentions. (I want kuchen now!)The book kept me riveted. I winced when Chloe worried if her heart was going to break but cheered as both Chloe and Roelke worked towards solving the murder cases while making smart choices for themselves.The period setting of the 1980s might throw some readers - no smartphones and sushi in Chloe's world - but Ernst makes it a painless read as you focus on the riveting mysteries she weaves together. Eagerly awaiting her next book!\n         ", u"\n           \n           What seemed like a cozy series that would be a relaxing read has turned into an increasingly interesting mix of murder mystery and social history. Tradition of Deceit, the fifth in the series so far, is the best yet.In this episode, Chloe, a curator at an ethnic museum in Wisconsin, and Roelke, Chloe's small town cop boyfriend, each go to the big city to meet with old friends. Chloe goes to Minneapolis, Roelke to Milwaukee. Each gets involved in solving a murder that occurs while they are there.As you might suspect, the murders, seemingly unrelated, do have a common thread, but Chloe and Roelke are unable to help each other, physically separated as they are, and by the uncertain nature of their relationship. While Chloe and Roelke undertake parallel adventures geographically, a third adventure takes place in the past, involving those who settled in the Midwest in the 19th century and of their descendants into the 20th century. Some things, it seems, never change.In past installments of this series, I've found myself skimming the historical bits, wanting to get back to the present (which in this series is actually the 1980s), but in Tradition of Deceit, the historical adventure is just as exciting as the present. Everything meshes together into a satisfying whole. Five stars!\n         ", u"\n           \n           I always feel like this series doesn't get the big press it should. It's fantastic and this installment is as well. After attending a friend's wedding with boyfriend/cop Roelke McKenna in Milwaukee, Chloe Ellefson heads to Minnesota and an old friend with an interesting historical plan. The old Washburn Mill, next to the Mississippi River, is being considered for a renovation to be a new historical site and museum. Chloe's friend Ariel is part of the team advocating for the Mill's future. The story of the mill, told through both present day Ariel and the eyes of some early female immigrants, one of whom even worked there in the early days, is fascinating. After a body is found at the Mill, Chloe finds herself mixed up in yet another murder investigation. Meanwhile, Roelke has taken a leave from the Eagle Police Department to hang around his former precinct in Milwaukee and help look into the death of a friend. It's truly Ernst's attention to historical detail that make this very traditional mystery series different than others. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'31000865', u'The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus', u'348', u'\n28525\nWashington Irving\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218187394p5/28525.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218187394p2/28525.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/28525.Washington_Irving\n3.86\n151068\n5017\n', u'2016', u'5', u'18', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Only to be hindering two young creatures that's wanting and wishing to settle down, as is only natural, and they not able to do it, and all because of me! Sure, sister dear, 'tis begging your pardon I do be often inclined to do--yes, indeed, many's the time; only there--'tis God sends it, you know, and it can't be different, whether or no.' Grania's face had run through several variations while Honor was speaking. By the time she had finished, however, her eyes were gentle and misty. 'A right brine-oge of a boy, ' the other continued complacently, smoothing down her blanket.

He details the process of alchemy, which involves looking at each Tarot card as an element. The interactions of the Tarot cards are like reactions that create molecules, and it is the interactions of the Tarot cards with each other that give depth and enlightenment in a Tarot reading. This process has given him the ability to determine specific timeframes and even names of people and places using the cards.<br /><br />His approach of deciphering the interactions in a scientific way leads to new insights about the meanings of the Tarot cards in a reading.

Tarot Alchemy is a totally new approach to tarot, using a scientific approach to reading the cards. Kenneth doesn't just toss you a few key words, obscure airy phases and tell you to use your intuition.Tarot Alchemy gives you a logical formula to apply to the cards, using astrology and numerology.This method has given me confidence in reading for others, and I have been amazed at the fine details I can now draw from the cards.The intuitive approach has never worked for me, and as such, I have never had much confidence in reading for others.My interpretations were usually fuzzy and didn't provide much detail or insight.That has changed immensely since I found this book. No longer am I left trying to draw information from a picture that I can't relate to my question, as Tarot Alchemy has given me so many layers to apply and draw from.Another benefit of this book, is it's simplicity.Using everyday, uncomplicated language, Kenneth opens up the world of advanced tarot to everyone. Tarot Alchemy is very easy to understand and to apply to your own readings.A must for anyone who uses the tarot.Tarot Alchemy will open up a whole new world.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'18052752', u'\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c', u'656', u'\n14162922\nVasily Aksyonov\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1439225569p5/14162922.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1439225569p2/14162922.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14162922.Vasily_Aksyonov\n3.89\n1864\n133\n', u'2002', u'', u'', u'\u042d\u043a\u0441\u043c\u043e', u'\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439, \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0410\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 - \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440, \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0445, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0433\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u044f \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043d\u0430\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u044d\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f - \u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0436\u044c\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u042d\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043a \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445\u0443 \u0438 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447, \u043c\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0435, \u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431, \u043e \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f, \u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 - \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043d\u044b, \u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430. \u0418 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e - \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438.', u'68', u'3.83', u'35', [], [], 0]!!!![u'15763060', u'Schokoherz', u'480', u'\n6446735\nAlice Castle\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1497331896p5/6446735.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1497331896p2/6446735.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6446735.Alice_Castle\n4.07\n41\n27\n', u'2011', u'', u'', u'', u'Endlich bekommt Bella das Angebot ihres Lebens.

Moments after the first plane struck, just twelve floors above him, Benfante organized his terrified employees, getting them out the office and moving down the stairwells. On his way down, he and another coworker encountered a woman in a wheelchair on the sixty-eighth floor. Benfante, the woman, and Benfante\u2019s coworker then embarked on a ninety-six-minute odyssey of escape\u2014the two men carrying the woman down sixty-eight flights of stairs out of the North Tower and into an ambulance that rushed her to safety just minutes before the tower imploded.\xa0A CBS video camera caught Benfante just as he got out of the building, and almost immediately, the national media came calling. Benfante sat on the couch with Oprah Winfrey, where she hailed him as a hero. Almost one year to the day after 9/11, Benfante got married and the woman in the wheelchair sat in the front row. \xa0<br /><br />That\u2019s the storybook ending. But in the aftermath of 9/11, Benfante began a journey fraught with wrenching personal challenges of critical emotional and psychological depth in\xa0Reluctant Hero. Benfante shares the trappings of his public heroism, the loneliness of his private anguish, and the hope he finds for himself and for us. Because all of us\u2014whether we were in the towers, in New York City, or someplace else\u2014we are all 9/11 survivors.', u'871', u'3.98', u'429', [(u'to-read', 348)], [u'\n           \n           This book was the true story of 9/11, not leaving out any of the disturbing details. That is one of the things that I liked about this book, he didn\'t try to sugar coat it. He told like it is, raw; and that\'s what 9/11 still is to a lot of people, raw. It is the story of how Michael Benfante (author) escaped the North Tower of the WTC on 9/11. How he and many others became heros with selfless acts of kindness. There were some definite parts of the book that I really enjoyed and there were some parts that I didn\'t. I enjoyed hearing the story of what happened from start to finish on 9/11, what he experienced, what he saw, what he did and how he felt. I enjoyed reading how how he dealt with it afterwards and how he felt and moved on from that day.I did not like how many pages and times he repeated the same things over and over about his anger. I understand that anger comes out of that day, I also understand the survivors guilt that he was dealing with. I think it is an important part of his story which was a good thing to tell. However I felt like it was filling pages or just dragging it out for lack of a better word. In a way I felt like the resolution that he felt was something that could have been added upon instead of dragging out the anger and hatred and dispair he fell into. There could have been a better balance rather than leaving the "letting go" part to a page and a half. Overall it was an entertaining book for the most part, and will give you a good idea of what it was like to be in the towers on that day, outside of the towers when they fell and the time afterwards in which to deal with what was seen.\n', u"\n           \n           This is a very affective book, I had dreams about the feelings and events Michael Benfante described. It is repetitious in places, almost like those documentaries which keep summing up what has happened so far in case you haven't caught on; however, it is the narrative of a man coming to terms with himself and his emotional reactions and should be read as such. I was fascinated by his description of 9/11 but perhaps even more so by the speed at which the media expected him to be able to be on call, coherent, and available. Also by the context he placed 9/11 in in terms of Enron etc... the corporate greed and how these companies treat their staff. They should have been named as well as shamed. Part of his personality comes out in how he directly praises or rebuffs those who deserve it. I would love to know Ron on Oprah's reaction to this and hers too! What is most amazing of all is that he gets so close to the truth: that everything is random and cannot be controlled except in the kindness we show to each other, truly part of natural selection then his last words are about God. Unbelievable.\n         ", u'\n           \n           This book was a pleasant surprise. I could not put it down once I started reading it. Informative, thoughtful, emotional and well written. \n         ', u'\n           \n           The church library where I work recently had the opportunity to host Michael Benfante as a speaker. Many members of the congregation read the book before he came to town, and virtually everyone tore through it in one or two days. All those who came to return their copy to the library walked in open-mouthed, saying the same thing: "Wow." We own 25 copies of the book, and haven\'t been able to keep them on the shelves.The first part of the book lays out Benfante\'s journey through hell on 9/11 in such unflinching detail that the experience felt immediate -- so much so that my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking. That being said, the real story follows what happens to Michael after the 9/11 media storm dies down. As a reader, this part of the book was equally gripping as Michael struggles through frustration, self-annihilation, anger and despair described in his down-to-earth, take-no-prisoners voice. I won\'t give anything away here, but Michael goes down a heartbreaking, dark path that has you pleading with him to return to the confident, charismatic, successful guy he was before 9/11, wrapping up the whole thing in a pretty bow at the end. But life is not a Hallmark card; his eventual redemption, still a work in progress, lies in a simple yet powerful message he discovers in one small, beautiful moment with his young son. Michael\'s hour-long presentation at my church left his audience transformed -- a powerful word, but the only way to adequately describe his influence. People stayed behind long after Benfante departed simply to discuss with each other how affected they were by his story and his not-preachy-but-nonetheless-spiritual message.He states that writing this book was simply meant to be a cathartic exercise for him; he seems genuinely surprised by a generally-cynical public\'s positive embrace. Do yourself a favor and read this book.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Before I read the part in the book about the "forgotten truth of 9/11" that Michael states in the book, I was talking with my best friend about we thought this was in fact forgotten. It was great to get validation about that from someone who lived through that horrible day who was there in the towers. Some parts were extremely difficult to read..especially certain things that Michael saw after getting out of the Tower. Nonetheless, reading this book puts into perspective what we should never forget from 9/11..the love and sacrifice thousands of people made that day that didn\'t make it into news stories or broadcasts. These unknown names and acts of heroism is what makes me proud to be born and raised in New York. Despite being a "reluctant hero", Michael Benfante is one of those people..even though he did only what he thought he did was right, some people aren\'t that selfless.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'26615580', u'Portraits of the Seventies (Classic Reprint)', u'592', u'\n5298459\nGeorge William Erskine Russell\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5298459.George_William_Erskine_Russell\n3.60\n20\n5\n', u'2017', u'4', u'12', u'Forgotten Books', u'Excerpt from Portraits of the Seventies <br />Not long ago an enterprising publisher approached me with suggestions about what he was good enough to call "the book we are all waiting for."

This thesis of a peculiar standardized diversification of sub-national space in the modern European Union is the point of departure of this book. </p><br /><p>Based upon the analytical premises of Stanford School Sociological Institutionalism, Sebastian M. B\xfcttner studies regional mobilization in contemporary Europe from a new and innovative perspective. He highlights the importance of scientific expertise and global scientific models in contemporary regional development practice, and exemplifies their significance with the example of region-building in Poland in the course of EU integration. This new wave of regional mobilization is not just conceived as an effect of local, national or European politics, but as an expression of a larger conceptual shift in governing society and space. </p><br /><p>This well researched and clearly argued book not only provides fresh insights into region-building and regionalization in contemporary European space, but also contributes to the new sociology of Europeanization. It will be an illuminating read for scholars and students in Sociology, European and EU studies, International Relations, Cultural Studies, Geography, Regional Science, Polish Studies and related subject areas. </p>', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'18532250', u'The Elevator', u' ', u'\n62999\nAngela Elwell Hunt\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1212001112p5/62999.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1212001112p2/62999.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/62999.Angela_Elwell_Hunt\n4.12\n45391\n4151\n', u'2013', u'5', u'15', u'Mira Books', u'In the path of a devastating hurricane, three very different women find themselves trapped in the elevator of a high-rise office building.

The real problem with this book is that she didn\'t make me care about any of the characters, I started liking one only to find out that they were uber-crazy and then I had no real care if they lived or died in The Elevator. Also it was marked \'Christian-fiction" in the library and it felt like she through that in at the very end. People decide to try to live better lives.

She can grab the reader's interest without letting up. She brings the characters to life without sleep-inducing detail. Because this story takes off from page 1 and doesn't slow down, schedule your time so you don't have to put it aside. Three women from different backgrounds get stuck in an elevator of a high rise building during an approaching hurricane. One has a lover and wants a commitment from him. She was on her way to his office to present to him an ultimatum. Another has a husband who is cheating on her. She was on her way to his office offering no ultimatum. The third woman had been on her way up to retrieve an item that she had left behind. Since they have a long wait for Eddie, the elevator repair man to show up, they slowly open up to one another, telling bits and pieces about their lives and loves. You can guess ahead of time what will emerge from these conversations but the way it comes about and the results are worth the read. You can empathize with each of these characters as their pain is brought out. And then there's Eddie...\n         ", u"\n           \n           Three women who have never met before are stuck in an elevator during a devastating hurricaine that is pounding Tampa, Florida. They all have secrets -- and it turns out they all center on the same man.I enjoyed this. I immediately connected with the characters, and the author's portrayal of their pasts and their conflicts kept me fascinated. Few secrets, since the reader knows from the back cover how they're all connected, but the writing is so good that I kept reading to see how they discovered it. And there are a few secrets revealed, enough to keep me turning pages to find out what would happen next. \n         ", u"\n           \n           I haven't read many christian novels lately, but my boss led me to read this one. I always have enjoyed Angela Hunt's books. Now, my boss likes books where all ends well and didn't like what happened to one of the main characters in the end. However, I was okay with it. We all make choices, wrong or right. That's just part of life. Wrong choice-bad ending. This was one of those stories that portrays that not every person makes the right choice. It is a novel with deep meaning and yet, it was a light novel.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Fabulous, couldn't put it down book full of action. Three women are stuck in an elevator...

The confessed killer is abducted on the way to jail and Detective Seth Harding must find both the killer and the kidnapper.I hesitate to say too much. I don't want to give away what happened in the first book. I always suggest reading series books in order .. in this instance, it's a must.The characters are great .... and there is one, especially, that really knocked me for a loop. There's lot of action and many of the same characters from the first book.This is a short, easy read, guaranteed to keep you glued to the pages until the very surprising end.4 Stars for the book ... 5 stars for the series.Many thanks to the author / Amazon Publishing / Netgalley who provided a digital copy in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.\n", u'\n           \n           The story continues from the celebrity murdered at the campground. As the murderer who has confessed is being transported he is abducted. Now the manhunt begins. Great 2nd part of the story. I would like to thank the Publisher and Net Galley for the chance to read this ARC. \n         ', u'\n           \n           For those who read the Rogue River novellas, Death and Her Devotion and Burned by Her Devotion are nice follow up stories to the next phase of the main characters.Burned by Her Devotion focuses on Zeth and Carly as Zeth picks up the investigation of the murder of Chase Ryan while Zane and Stevie are on their honeymoon. The investigation takes a few interesting twists which I really enjoyed. I also enjoyed seeing Zeth and Carly working together and growing as a couple. Special Thanks to Montlake Romance via NetGalley\n', u'\n           \n           Although not a typical fan of novellas, since I love all the other books from this author I decided to check this out too, so of course I had to go back and read all the other novellas in the series first so I was up to date! Read this book in one short sitting as it was engaging and a nice easy read! Great mystery - check!Suspense - check!Thrills - check!Romance - check!Character development - check! Satisfying ending - check!What more could I ask for?So glad I decided to give this series of novellas a read, I was not at all disappointed as I often am with novellas!Thanks to Netgalley for an advanced reader copy of this book for an honest review \n         '], 0]!!!![u'26800473', u"\nSuperman: The World's Finest Comics Archives, Vol. 2 by Jerry Siegel\n", u' ', u'\n13605184\nClaudia Cantun Bolles\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13605184.Claudia_Cantun_Bolles\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28022014', u'The Human Element: Understanding and Managing Employee Behavior', u'209', u'\n148070\nLee Roy Beach\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/148070.Lee_Roy_Beach\n3.57\n28\n1\n', u'2015', u'3', u'12', u'Routledge', u'Here\'s practical help for the day-to-day concerns that keep managers awake at night. Written in an informal, first-person style, this useful book fills the gap between the legal and policy issues that are the mainstay of human resources and supervision courses and the real-world needs of managers as they attempt to cope with the human side of their jobs. The author is a noted scholar in both cognitive psychology and organizational studies, and has drawn from extensive personal experience as well as careful observation of good and bad managers. "The Human Element" is organized around six fundamental commitments that good employee managers make in order to succeed. It is filled with practical examples and step-by-step guidelines for performing important tasks and dealing with common problems - everything from how to conduct a meeting, to how to write a code of conduct, to how to diagnose the cause of performance problems. "The Human Element" is designed to reduce the stress of management by providing insight into why employees do what they do, and what to do about it. It is an ideal supplement for any course in "people management," including supervision, HRM, and applied OB courses.', u'5', u'4.00', u'2', [], [], 0]!!!![u'22832321', u'CMOS Analog Integrated Circuits: High-Speed and Power-Efficient Design', u'914', u'\n6091301\nTertulien Ndjountche\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6091301.Tertulien_Ndjountche\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2014', u'5', u'14', u'CRC Press', u'High-speed, power-efficient analog integrated circuits can be used as standalone devices or to interface modern digital signal processors and micro-controllers in various applications, including multimedia, communication, instrumentation, and control systems.

CMOS: Analog Integrated Circuits: High-Speed and Power-Efficient Design describes the important trends in designing these analog circuits and provides a complete, in-depth examination of design techniques and circuit architectures, emphasizing practical aspects of integrated circuit implementation.<br /><br />Focusing on designing and verifying analog integrated circuits, the author reviews design techniques for more complex components such as amplifiers, comparators, and multipliers. The book details all aspects, from specification to the final chip, of the development and implementation process of filters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), phase-locked loops (PLLs), and delay-locked loops (DLLs). It also describes different equivalent transistor models, design and fabrication considerations for high-density integrated circuits in deep-submicrometer process, circuit structures for the design of current mirrors and voltage references, topologies of suitable amplifiers, continuous-time and switched-capacitor circuits, modulator architectures, and approaches to improve linearity of Nyquist converters. The text addresses the architectures and performance limitation issues affecting circuit operation and provides conceptual and practical solutions to problems that can arise in the design process.<br /><br />This reference provides balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues that will allow the reader to design CMOS analog integrated circuits with improved electrical performance. The chapters contain easy-to-follow mathematical derivations of all equations and formulas, graphical plots, and open-ended design problems to help determine most suitable architecture for a given set of performance specifications.

Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg bestanden Oberpostdirektionen zunachst in den Besatzungszonen und spater in den beiden deutschen Staaten fort. In der DDR wurden die Oberpostdirektionen 1954 aufgelost und neue Bezirksdirektionen geschaffen. Aufgabe einer Oberpostdirektion war es, das Generalpostamt in Berlin zu entlasten. Als neue Mittelbehorde hatten sie die Verwaltung der in ihrem Bezirk arbeitenden Postanstalten, die Personalfuhrung und das Kassenwesen zu erledigen.

"Trust Your Heart; Transform Your Ideas Into Income", by Marnie Pehrson, is filled with valuable success tips from nineteen online entrepreneurs. Read about the life lessons that these entrepreneurs learned while following their heart and building the businesses of their dreams. This book begins with Marnie Pehrson\'s story. Marnie had two young children in 1989 and needed to find a way to earn income from her home. She had taken computer classes in college and thought she might be able to teach others some basic progams that were used in business offices. She placed an ad in the newspaper offering to teach WordPerfect, Pagemaker and Lotus 1-2-3 from her home. Within a few months, she was teaching 50 hours a week in a spare bedroom. She wrote a book on how to run a successful computer training buisiness from your home. She went on to develop the first online shopping mall and IdeaMarketers.com. Ms. Pehrson interviews eighteen other entrepreneurs in this book. They all tell how they got started, the difficult circumstances they overcame and how they went on to build a successful business. Each story is very special in its own way. All the entrepreneurs have one thing in common...they followed their hearts and transformed ideas into income. I learned something from each one of the interviews in this book. I realized that these were just normal people that started from scratch and persevered until they achieved success. Here are some things that seemed to be repeated in many of the interviews; Believe in yourself. You must believe that you have the ability to build a business. Marketing is everthing. Many of the interviews stressed how important marketing is to building a business. Having a great product is not enough, you have to get the word out to your potential customers. It will not always be a bed of roses. All of the people interviewed have had to deal with serious financial, family and relationship problems. Many lost/quit their jobs and were desparate for an income to survive. Some had to cope with illness and death in their families. Connect with a mentor. Don\'t be afraid to seek help. Many of these entrepreneurs enrolled in coaching programs that provided guidance and direction for them as they grew their businesses. Never give up. This is the univeral theme of this book. You have to be determined to make it work. If you are interested in building an online business, you will find real value in this book. It will provide the boost that you need to transform your ideas into income! \n'], 0]!!!![u'22205775', u'Pretty Little Liars #6: Killer', u'352', u'\n93970\nSara Shepard\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1229580414p5/93970.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1229580414p2/93970.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/93970.Sara_Shepard\n3.99\n742784\n40215\n', u'2009', u'6', u'30', u'HarperCollins Publishers', u'In picture-perfect Rosewood, Pennsylvania, ash-blond highlights gleam in the winter sun and frozen lakes sparkle like Swarovski crystals.

After all, the quicker I read them the quicker they\u2019re all gone. My difficulty is not so much with how bad the books are (after all, there\u2019s no harm in a bit of trash every now and then) as how incredibly boring. It goes against the tenets of trash writing, which should be so entertaining in its drama that you forgive the ridiculousness. If you\u2019re going to read something bad, it should be absurdly, histrionically bad. (See Flowers in the Attic or What Ever Happened to Baby Jane for example) Sadly there is no Grand Guignol horror or grotesque excess here, as there should rightfully be. Just mundanity and handbags.  The prologue flashback is even less interesting this time, since it\u2019s yet more information I do not want about the bloody flag-hunt business (see all of the last book). We also learn that Rosewood is the type of place that turns 6-year-olds learning to read into an official competition. Because if you can\u2019t be the best at something, it\u2019s not worth doing it at all. It also turns out that all 4 of the girls turned up at Alison\u2019s house to steal her flag-piece at exactly the same time, independently of each other. I know there\u2019s somewhat of a herd mentality at Rosewood, but that seems pretty impressive. Hopefully this psychic-bond all the children share will be developed later and the books will take a more Midwich Cuckoos (Village of the Damned) direction. Otherwise we learn nothing knew, and have some old and boring information hammered into our heads once again.Back in the present we pick up exactly where we left off. Ian is still dead. We are clumsily reminded that we are now supposed to be suspicious of Officer Wilden, because Shepard says so. She neglects to say why, but that\u2019s as standard. Then Ian\u2019s body disappears, as tends to happen in these type of stories. Everyone immediately panics. Then the process of obsessive recapping begins.  There isn\u2019t a great deal of forward momentum in the plot for the main bulk of the book. We learn that Aria has moved in with her father to avoid being sexually harassed by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, failing to warn either her mother or anyone else about the borderline rapist who they all trust. Then Aria\u2019s father suddenly declares that he has bought a house in the middle of the Rosewood Murder Triangle, but forgot to mention it earlier because it hadn\u2019t occurred to Shepard yet. Emily\u2019s boyfriend teaches her to eat peanut butter and honey butties, which are indeed nicer than peanut butter and jam, but don\u2019t really add much to the story. We are reminded to suspect Jason, Alison\u2019s brother, because he\u2019s vaguely shouty and looks just like Alison. Hanna fondly reminisces about the time when the time when they were all children and Mike deliberately lurked about in the dark in the middle of the night to sexually assault Alison, but accidentally groped Hanna instead; she appears to find this sweet. Spencer\u2019s dull essay storyline and her dull Andrew \u2013the-obvious-boyfriend storyline continue to coalesce into one single lump of boredom. Everyone keeps going on about how much they want Ian to fry for Alison\u2019s murder, which is not only cruel but inaccurate since although Pennsylvania, disturbingly enough, is one of the US states that still insists on the death penalty, their preferred method is lethal injection. Shepard keeps telling us what every boy in the series smells like in weird detail. We learn that only old ladies drink mint tea, which added to last book\u2019s revelation that lesbians all drink jasmine tea makes me presume that there\u2019s a very strict hot-drink hierarchy in Rosewood, which will hopefully be revealed in full in an exciting future volume of this series. Also, the Warhol banana appears again. I\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s some type of a clue, it appears so frequently. Maybe Nico killed Alison? The most exciting development is that it\u2019s flag-hunt time again! Whilst we wait to find out how that thrilling saga will unravel, we are treated to endless scenes of Emily and her perfect boyfriend, who even loves the smell of chlorine in her hair, and who lives in a house with \u201cPrayer Changes Everything\u201d embroidered on the cushions. They possibly have sex, although it\u2019s hard to tell because Ms Shepard never goes any further in her descriptions of these things than the boy involved touching the edge of the girl\u2019s bra, which seems to be a bit of a fetish in Rosewood and also means another chance to describe clothes. Meanwhile Spencer arranges a meeting with a woman who the internet has told her is her birth mother, even though she hasn\u2019t even asked if she\u2019s adopted yet. To fill in time whilst waiting for this meeting she copies her father\u2019s entire hard drive onto what is a very capacious CD in order to search it for adoption documents. Meanwhile her mother continues to disown her for being stalked and having had her best friend murderer, which constitutes top-quality parenting in Rosewood.After a while the girls get together and conclude, pretty much by making it up as they go along, that Ian faked his own death in order to distract them whilst he escaped from Rosewood, but then stayed in Rosewood anyway. This makes no sense whatsoever. My theory is that Ian faked his own death because Sara Shepard needed a cliffhanger ending for Wicked Pretty Little Liars 5, which I think hangs together a lot better (the theory, not the awful book). Then everyone proceeds with their lives, eating branded foods I\u2019ve never heard of and constantly just catching in the corner of their eye what might or might not be a stalker. Emily does that bad-drama scene where the heroine finds a picture of herself with the head cut off and panics, presuming that the photo\u2019s owner is out to get her. She also receives an annoying \u2018clue\u2019 photo from \u2018A\u2019, which no one can be bothered with.Spencer goes off to New York on her own to meet a stranger called Olivia who claims to be her birth mother, and they immediately go shopping for designer clothes. No questions are asked about this alleged adoption, which so far exists entirely in Spencer\u2019s imagination, until they have thoroughly exhausted all the best shops. Eventually Olivia tells some vague story about giving Spencer away because as a rich and privileged eighteen-year-old she wasn\u2019t sure she could cope with a baby. Immediately thereafter Spencer offers to finish school a year earlier and move to New York so they can be closer, and Olivia suggests renting her an apartment. I don\u2019t know if this kind of behaviour is normal for rich people, but it\u2019s definitely incredibly stupid. Then Olivia flies away in her personal helicopter, as you do, accidentally leaving Spencer with a mystery folder which sadly turns out to contain nothing interesting.Aria becomes more proactive about her fetish for inappropriate men, deliberately hanging around a train station until she meets potential murderer and weirdo Jason and propositioning him. He immediately takes her to a bar named after the Bates Motel from Psycho Robert Bloch, which means that it would be too obvious if he were \u2018A\u2019. They immediately exchange secrets and flirt heavily. Hanna is meanwhile impressing Aria\u2019s brother by her amazing knowledge of music, specifically that she has heard of Led Zeppelin. This is apparently quite impressive in Rosewood. More amazingly still she knows two of their songs and is able to sing along to them, which obviously makes her pretty cool. Mike is as creepy as ever, taking Hanna on a date to try on some tiny bikinis he has already picked out for her and then deliberately bursting in when she is changing. Luckily Hanna is flattered to have any male attention, since she is an idiot, and so doesn\u2019t do anything about this. We also learn that whilst Mike was in Europe he learned how to say \u201cunderwear model\u201d in Mandarin, which makes sense as long as you consider \u201cabroad\u201d to be one big place where all the people speak in the same set of funny languages which you can use to impress girls. Even though he is vilely sexist and is dating Hanna and Kate at the same time both of them continue to fight over him as though winning his brief approval of them as a sex object will validate them as a person and cement their victory over the other. It\u2019s quite difficult to believe that two people could be this simultaneously stupid. Plot becomes even more sparse as the book continues. Spencer\u2019s parents horrify her by suggesting that she get a job. Hanna remembers something, but can\u2019t remember what she remembers. In a particularly impressive show of idiocy Spencer decides to steal a large amount of money from her parents in order to rent a massively luxurious New York apartment. This makes sense because a man she has never met, who is married to the possible birth mother she has met once, will definitely reimburse her fully as soon as he finds out. Plus she feels entitled to the apartment because\u2026actually, I\u2019m not sure why. Just because. Many characters suddenly become emotional, start stuttering and leave the room for reasons not explained for several chapters. Isaac\u2019s mother threatens Emily, but she doesn\u2019t tell him for a while in order to drag matters out for a few more pages. When she does he immediately admits that his last girlfriend said the same thing, but is still certain that both his ex and Emily are crazy liars and the fact that they came up with the same fabrication is coincidence. Hanna has yet another Haunted Oracular Dream which yields the first clue which sounds even vaguely interesting, Alighost\u2019s:  \u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t notice I\u2019m singing\u201d. Which reminds me of a combination of Laura Palmer\u2019s two dream clues \u201cSometimes my arms bend back.\u201d and \u201cWhere we're from the birds sing a pretty song, and there's always music in the air\u201d A finger-snapping dwarf and a mynah bird would really liven the story up around now, but sadly it is not to be. Instead we move on to some fluff about proms and dating, which takes a long time to go nowhere. Also at around this time the obsession with clothes reaches such a pitch that we\u2019re informed that exact outfit a UPS delivery man is wearing as he makes a one-line appearance delivering organic baby booties. Meanwhile Jason, Jenna, Melissa and Officer Wilden continue to behave \u201csuspiciously\u201d whilst not actually doing anything that unusual or interesting. Somebody uses a Rottweiler to trick Aria into breaking into Jason\u2019s house, which doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense or achieve anything. Spencer\u2019s supposed birth mother turns out to be a con-artist and steals all her university money, which I don\u2019t care about and which entirely serves Spencer right. Mike finds out that Hanna is only using him, and hypocritically finds this offensive; simultaneously Hanna decides she is actually deeply in love with Mike after all. Then they make-up because they are both too vacant to hold a grudge. The whole thing is ridiculous.As the end mercifully draws near everyone attends yet another of these benefit things that seem so popular with the rich and vain, delightfully enough held at what used to be a home for mentally ill children but is now a luxury hotel. Although it\u2019s now refurbished the decorators have helpfully left a few rooms untouched, in order to allow a suitably overused gothic background for events. This is possibly another set stolen from the US Ring Ring 1 remake, although with clich\xe9s this ingrained it\u2019s hard to identify a particular bad horror film. Emily blunders into one of these rooms, blunders upon an old inmate ledger full of sensitive information which has been left lying around in public view, and 5 seconds later finds Jason\u2019s name. The whole thing is so far beyond terrible that there\u2019s no criticism worth making .Hanna however has decided that the murderer is Officer Wilden, on the basis that he has a hooded top and keeps singing the Elvis Costello song \u201cAlison\u201d, although sadly not the most appropriate lines:  Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talkingWhen I hear the silly things that you say  Then it\u2019s the usual conclusion, where the girls get together and voice their suspicions by reciting every single thing that has happened to them in this book, before racing crazily about in a panic because one of them is in danger. The potential victim is once again Spencer, who is at home in her barn reading The House of Mirth and demonstrating that she has failed to understand it by identifying with the heroine. However she quickly tires of her efforts to centre a classic work of literature around herself and starts to read her sister\u2019s notes from school instead. Immediately she finds one with clues relevant to the drama currently occurring. Directly afterward the other girls arrive, and fugitive Ian turns out to be online at that exact moment waiting to answer their questions. He accuses Wilden and Jason whereupon Spencer, the world\u2019s least credible witness, immediately changes her \u201cmemories\u201d to fit this story. Then someone sets the barn on fire, just for a bit of drama at the end of the chapter. Everyone escapes this rather inefficient murder attempt instantly, and the four of them then run directly into the plot-twist I have been hoping for 6 books wasn\u2019t coming. I reach new heights of despair, and the book ends.Most Ridiculous Local Shops Either \u201cthe eco baby store \u2026that sold organic baby booties made out of recycled soda bottles for a hundred dollars.\u201d or \u201ca pet store that sold homemade dog food and costumes for cats.\u201d Character Having the Most Difficulty Keeping Up \u201c \u201cJust because the A notes weren\u2019t coming from Ian\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t coming from Ian\u2026 he could have gotten a disposable cell or a phone in another name.\u201dEmily put her finger to her lips. She hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d Why not? It\u2019s exactly what A#1 did a few months back. It\u2019s simply not possible Emily could be that stupid, surely?Least Psychological Understanding Demonstrated  \u201cThere was no way Jason abused Ali\u2026. In fact, Jason had always seemed fiercely protective of Ali.\u201d Clearly indisputable proof of his innocence. More convincingly, there\u2019s no actual evidence or indeed indication that he did, beyond the fact that some of the girls like to imagine so. Which seems to me to be a more reasonable argument in favour of giving him the benefit of the doubt.Worst Date Talk Mike suggestively complimented Hanna on her sucking abilities and advised her to save some sucking power for later. Most Random Physiological Reaction \u201cEmily swallowed hard. She tasted peanut butter in her mouth, the sensation she always got when she was about to have a fight-or-flight reaction.\u201d I know that peanut butter is very popular in the US, but I had no idea that their citizens were able to spontaneously produce in times of stress. Must be very useful in times of potential starvation.Worst Attempt at a Hotel ThemeA Palace of Versailles motif featuring a DJ dressed up in a Louis XIV wig and a large tapestry of Napoleon. The whole thing is apparently based on the vague ideas that every single French historical figure lived in the same building, a giant gilt hall of mirrors, during the era \u201cOld-Days France\u201d. And since the d\xe9cor also includes \u201ca stained-glass window that featured a portrait of a piefaced minstrel and his lute\u201d it would appear that Medieval Europe has somehow got mixed up in there somehow.Most Unnecessary-Sounding Beauty Treatment \u201can oxygen facial\u201d Can\u2019t you get oxygen on your face by walking around outside?. For free? I guess I\u2019m missing summat here.Worse and worse. The whole last part of this book is too terrible even to be a joke. Even if everything turns out to be some type of elaborate set-up it wouldn\u2019t excuse the clumsy execution or the complete lack of sense or realistic behaviour exhibited by any of the girls. The moment when Emily casually wandered through a doorway leading straight from the luxury hotel set into the cobweb-strewn gothic asylum set was the breaking point for me. Unless the whole series turns out to be some sort of meta-textual story-within-a-story taking place in the mind of a mad girl running about in a movie backlot then it\u2019s irredeemable. And I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not going to happen. \n", u'\nKiller is the sixth book in the Pretty Little Liars series, and this one definitely isn\u2019t my favourite of them.This instalment of the series made my love for these books waver. I have to admit that it pretty much annoyed me and I got a little bit fed up. It seemed to get a tad repetitive. Aria falling for inappropriate guys, Spencer getting tangled in lies and mistakes, Emily having serious girl/boy issues and Hanna battling to be Queen Bee. It\u2019s been that way since the first book.A was the only one that wasn\u2019t the same. He/she seemed to have a new agenda, focused less on the girls\u2019 exploits and didn\u2019t play such a large part in Killer. A\u2019s texts and emails brought up so many new questions and answered hardly any of them.But any ill will I had towards Killer had evaporated by the last few shocking chapters. Sara Shepard really does know how to deliver an explosive cliffhanger! I was left staring blankly with shock and confusion for a good five minutes after turning the last page of Killer.After Killer\u2019s shock ending, I\u2019ll be reading book seven, Heartless, as soon as it\u2019s released next January. I will definitely be seeing this series through to the end, if only to find out what\u2019s really going on!\n         ', u"\n           \n           At this point, the formula that all of the books follow is way too repetitive. If I didn't already own all of the books, this is the point where I would definitely give them up. There is going to be some sort of memory of when the girls were younger and Ali was still alive. The girls will flashback to this a million times throughout the book. New information will only be revealed half of the time. There will be at least one party. Aria's story is going to involve her getting involved with an older guy. In at least one of the girls' parts, a previously established character is going to start acting really weird so that suspense can be maintained during their sections even though nothing is really happening. The last chapters will be super exciting and have a major cliffhanger, so that readers will not mind how boring the rest of the book was.While this is a problem to some extent in all of the books, this one relies on the girls being stupid to maintain the usual pattern of the books more than any of the rest so far. For A to continue blackmailing the girls, A has become involved in more and more mundane parts of their lives. At some points, A is speculated to be a criminal genius. The only way for this to be an excusable part of the plot is if the point is supposed to be that these girls are just getting paranoid.These books really rely on the ending, and this one just did not do it for me. The ending was half as much of the book as it usually is, and it just wasn't long enough to generate as much suspense. The only part of this book that I enjoyed in comparison to the rest of the series is that Mike is getting a slightly bigger role, and Mike is one of the only members of the supporting cast that I still really like.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Sometimes, when reading a Pretty Little Liars novel, I find myself marveling at the girls' lives, disbelieving them. While I, too, hail from Pennsylvania, my hometown is the antithesis of the fictional Rosewood \u2013 fictional being the all-important word there, because there are moments when I question whether such places could really exist. But they do. Shop for real estate in the towns which dot the real Main Line outside of Philadelphia; check out the King of Prussia mall which the series' King James mall is based upon. Hollis could easily be Bryn Mawr. It's just that Aria, Spencer, Emily, and Hanna's lives are so far removed from what I consider normal... and I'm not just talking about the secrets and lies; the entire setting verges on the fantastic for someone who, at best, was raised in a middle class family environment. Rather, it's the opulence, the sense of entitlement, the galas, and the absolute disregard for the rules that the rest of society follows, but these are all stereotypes found in any affluent society depicted in film and television or in books. Whether fair or not, stereotypes exist for a reason, and I think it's this shock and awe towards places like Rosewood which draw readers (in this case) into the Liars' world. While it can seem foreign, even alien, it's also appealing... even if we recognize that, despite the girls' every advantage, their lives aren't perfect either. At the root of their unhappiness \u2013 and ours \u2013 are the same, basic problems: communication and trust.Killer picks up directly where the previous novel in the series left off with the girls convinced that they've found Ian's dead body... only the body has disappeared and they're eventually labeled as the girls who cried wolf in order to claim more of the spotlight. Things just continue to spiral out of control as the book progresses. While Aria finds herself yet another older man \u2013 this time, Alison's brother, Jason, Spencer's searching for her birth mother and getting scammed... or so it seems... in the process. Meanwhile, Emily finds out that her new boyfriend's mother hates her after she sleeps with him, and Hanna continues her popularity games with her step-sister Kate, all the while, though, the four girls continue to get texts and clues from A. Despite being burned in the past for failing to talk to one another, they continue to keep secrets, using A's words to further their own agendas rather than banding together, actually communicating, and solving the mysteries destroying their lives. Yes, some of this is motivated by their selfishness, but, mainly, it's inspired by their lack of trust in each other and their insistence upon giving their trust to the wrong people.But there's the beauty of Shepard's books: readers don't know who to trust either. Everyone has an agenda. Basically, it boils down to two things. One, the girls know that they're not A; they can't say the same about anyone else. And, two, for whatever their personal reasons, they all have the same goals as far as A and Ali's murderer are concerned: they want them caught, stopped, and punished. For these reasons and these reasons alone \u2013 whether its lonely or not, Aria, Spencer, Emily, and Hanna need to shelve their reservations, put aside their personal lives, and truly start to work together to figure out what's really going on, because, as of now, A's winning. A always wins, and, until the Liars start to communicate and trust each other, A will continue to have free reign to do whatever A wants.\n         ", u"\nKiller by Sara ShepardBook six in the Pretty Little Liars seriesFirst of all, that ending oh my goshhhh! Now I'm even more excited to continue with this series! Giving this one three stars because not a lot was going on throughout it, until the end of course, but the girls individual stories weren't particularly that interesting in this one. Especially compared to the last book, which has been my favourite so far!I did guess who A, or in this books case A's, would be, but I wasn't really expecting the ending, despite having watched the TV-Show! I also saw that Spencer thing coming... I mean it was way too good for her to be true, right? I hope Kate and Hanna's relationship grows more into friendship in the next book... I'm in love with Sara Shepard's books, and can't wait to see where the story goes now, after that ending!! \n         "], 0]!!!![u'29779584', u'\u97e9\u975e\u5b50\u6743\u672f\u4eba\u751f (\u4f20\u4e16\u540d\u5bb6\u7ecf\u5178\u6587\u4e1b)', u' ', u'\n7540841\n\u8521\u666f\u4ed9 \u4e3b\u7f16\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7540841._\n4.00\n2\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'22367610', u'Unwilling Accomplice: A Munch Mancini Crime Novel (Munch Mancini Novels)', u' ', u'\n5093\nBarbara Seranella\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349206149p5/5093.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349206149p2/5093.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5093.Barbara_Seranella\n3.78\n930\n116\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'"Munch Mancini and little daughter Asia are doing just fine. Munch rejoices in her job as an auto mechanic at the Brentwood Texaco. She and Asia have a house -- not in tony Brentwood -- and a dog, and Munch has been off drugs for years.

It\'s tough, though, when people from her old life resurface. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Such a person is Lisa Slokum, Asia\'s aunt. Lisa has always meant trouble, and why should now be any different? It seems she has bolted from the Witness Protection Program with her two daughters, fifteen-year-old Charlotte and eleven-year-old Jill, and she needs Munch\'s help. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Would that it were so simple. Munch will need to call upon Rico Chacon, a fine cop but not-so-fine boyfriend whose commitment to her on the nonprofessional side seems to be wavering. And before Munch can sort out her love life she must try on the role of auntie to Asia\'s new cousins -- not easy when the teenaged Charlotte goes missing and her mom, Lisa, lands in jail. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why did Charlotte run away, and where is she now?

Munch thought Lisa and her daughters had been relocated by the feds in the witness protection program and she really didn\u2019t have any wish to see Lisa again. But it seems Lisa left the program and is now back in California with her daughters, and now it seems her daughters want to meet their cousin, Asia. Munch isn\u2019t that thrilled but agrees to meet them in a park. The meeting doesn\u2019t go real well except that the cousins seem excited to meet. Then a few days later Munch gets a call at work that Charlotte, the older of the two girls, is missing and Lisa says she\u2019s been kidnapped. She doesn\u2019t want Munch to go to the police and she seems to know things that she won\u2019t tell Munch, but Munch agrees to try to help anyway for the sake of the little girls. She does however insist on involving at least her cop friend, Detective St. John, and her former boy friend, Rico, a homicide cop. Then a boy\u2019s body is found, someone in Charlotte\u2019s class, and another boy has been killed as well. Munch and the police believe there are connections between those two deaths and Charlotte\u2019s disappearance, and also with some missing jewelry from a wealthy family. This is again one of those thrillers filled with auto-mechanical know-how that Seranella was great at writing. Many surprises and twists and turns, including some possibility that Munch and Rico might get back together. Quite good, but more focus on the romance in this one than I was interested in. \n', u"\n           \n           #7 Munch Mancini mystery set in 1980's Los Angeles, and featuring our favorite female mechanic and ex-junkie. Things are going along well for Munch and her adopted daughter Asia when a blast from the past--Asia's aunt Lisa and her two girls--call and ask to get together. Munch, clean and sober for many years now, is always reluctant to let her past leak into her new, stable life, but Lisa is Asia's blood kin and Asia wants to meet her cousins, so she agrees. When the elder daughter Charlotte goes missing a couple of days later, a distraught Lisa calls Munch as the police don't seem very interested in a Goth-looking fifteen-year-old whom they think ran away. Charlotte was friends with a boy who was killed a few days previously as part of a robbery, and Munch wonders if this had something to do with her disappearance--Lisa is convinced she was abducted, and some threatening phone calls later bear this out. Meanwhile, Munch learns some interesting information about Rico, her former boyfriend who had broken their relationship off when his ex-girlfriend turned up pregnant, as he planned to 'do the right thing' and marry her. I always enjoy a visit with Munch and Asia and Munch's unique perspective on life and this book was no exception. Only one left in the series. :( \n         ", u"\n           \n           UNWILLING ACCOMPLICE (Amateur Sleuth - non-cozy) \u2013 G+Barbara Saranella \u2013 7th bookMunch Mancini receives a call from her daughter's aunt, who wants the girl to meet her cousins. When one of the cousins goes missing soon after the meeting, Munch is drawn into finding the girl and discovers a ring of exploited and endangered children and teens.***I didn\u2019t feel this was the strongest book of the series and found the story a bit less suspenseful than others in the past. It\u2019s interesting that as Munch becomes more \u201cmainstream,\u201d which is great for the growth of the character, she is less edgy and interesting. It\u2019s still a very good series with a wonderful, strong, female character, but I\u2019m going to be interested to see where it goes from here.\n", u"\n           \n           Munch is another year clean and sober and a hard working, loving mother to Asia, her adopted daughter. When Asia's cousins and aunt turn up living nearby and asking for help, Munch is drawn back into proximity to the tempting world of drugs and booze that she left behind. A world that threatens the lives of her young nieces and makes Munch want to lock Asia up to keep her safe.

I felt outrage upon reading about the inhumane treatment but at times these feelings were balanced with the hope that some of the boys could escape their hell.The author Michael D\u2019Antonio has a gift as a journalist and his storytelling was on full display here. His writing style has a certain warmth and humanity to it despite that the subject matter is at times horrifying.I won\u2019t give the plot twists of the story away here but D\u2019Antonio follows the lives of several boys who were incarcerated in a boys home for the feeble minded, many of whom were forced into the home despite average or near average intelligence. This had a lot to do with whether disadvantaged mothers could fight the system to keep their kids. Most of the story takes place during the 1950\u2019s when the boys were at the school. This period was during the height of the eugenics craze. The tests and crimes perpetrated against the boys are difficult to wrap one\u2019s head around. The remainder of the book follows a few of those who made it out into the real world and eventually some measure of redemption in the 1990\u2019s.Very strong recommendation. \n', u"\n           \n           I was fascinated by this book, it's quite tragic but hopeful at the same time.

Excerpt: The Crab Clan Champion is the leader of the Crab Clan. He must be the foremost example of the duty of all Crab to defend the Empire against the Shadowlands. His courage inspires all other Crab warriors to stand fast against evil. The Crab Clan Champion has always been the daimyo of the Hida family. The following are the known Champions of the Crab Clan: The Kami Hida was the founder of the Crab Clan as well as the physically strongest of the Kami. Hida fathered two sons after his fall into the Mortal Realm, Hida Atarasi and Hida Osano-Wo. Hida fell first in the Tournament of the Kami, losing out to the quickness of Shinjo. Afterwards, he berated himself for hours, cursing his clumsiness and inability to marshal his strength effectively. Shinsei told him his inability to accept his weakness caused him to fall. Knowing this, Hida's weakness transformed into strength. Hida took what the man had told him and over the years he learned to temper his strength with strategy, watching the Lion and Dragon Clans gain their tactical knowledge. By the time Fu Leng rose to challenge Hantei, Hida was the most feared warrior in Rokugan. Hida led the Crab at the vanguard of battles. The Crab would take heavy casualities, but they made sure every oni paid for every step into Rokugan.

To repay that debt, Lynch offers to help the Warriors reverse a spell that would wreak havoc on their World. Of course, he neglected to mention that action would serve his own interests as well. In the process, Lynch discovers much to his chagrin that he does still have a soul and a conscience. <br /><br />He also discovers that the Warriors are fighting a battle they can\u2019t win against a common enemy, a Wizard named Timon Backhelm.

But when Lynch realizes the extent of Timon\u2019s power, he knows the only way to win is to initiate the creation of the Dragonspawn, a magical, physical blend of the strengths of a Dragon and an ultimate Warrior.

It seems Lorn Graywolf and his warriors have been sent by their council on all sorts of tasks which have kept them away from their home for over 2 years, but these tasks were never meant to be completed, they were meant to cause their deaths. They have had to fight some terrible battles, heavy storms, and more. During a storm, Lorn pulled a man from the sea, and saved him from drowning only to find that he saved a Dark Wizard named Lynch. Lynch has done some horrific deeds in his past which has spanned many lifetimes but he owes Lorn his life and offers to help him get to his home and to help them return their lands to normal after Lynch has told them of the happenings there which are not good.There are many characters in this story each of whom could warrant their own book, I loved Smilin Jake, his character is particular interesting, Ox is another who seems to be a big silent type but deadly nevertheless. Lorn is a father, and a man oh honour and he is shocked to find that his council has been dishonest and that his people the magrii'ri are suffering terrible things because of them.

Local Traditions.--Capture of the castle--King James's visit--Curate of Sanquhar--Tradition of the Sampler--Incidents at the castle--Story of Abraham Crichton--Legend of Crawick Mill. Having noticed the antiquities, we now proceed to present the reader with some of the old traditions that are still afloat in the district. Almost every place has its local traditions, either more or less interesting. These traditions are some of them found to embody a considerable share of veritable history, because in ancient times even striking and interesting incidents and general occurrences were not committed to writing. They were left to sail down the stream of time in the memories of the native inhabitants, generation after generation, with almost undeviating accuracy. Some very cautious people are inclined to regard tradition as a thing of uncertainty; but this is done without due consideration or sifting inquiry. There is far more reality in oral traditions than many are aware of, as could easily be shown by an induction of particulars. No tradition has arisen without a veritable foundation, and in its descent from age to age, it is more likely to lose than to gain, so that the real bones of the story are preserved, while in the lapse of time the more interesting portions are entirely forgotten. Another thing in favour of these traditions is, that they are generally short, and this circumstance, as Disraeli remarks, insures their correctness. At any rate, these traditionary fragments are commonly fraught with an interest pleasing to the popular, mind, and are often remarkably instructive. They are portions of unwritten history which well deserve to be arrested in their progress to oblivion, as to this every thing that is left to merely...", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'31064049', u'The Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe', u'328', u'\n4624490\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454522972p5/4624490.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454522972p2/4624490.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4624490.Edgar_Allan_Poe\n4.18\n1044527\n23086\n', u'2016', u'5', u'19', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

But, even in this time of peace, a new figure emerges in Karakura Town. Now questioning his allies and with a new threat around the corner, Ichigo must choose to fight again as another battle begins.Now many fans of Bleach had thought the series would finish with the defeat of Aizen by Ichigo. And in a way it did seem like the end was near. However, things could not just finish like this with many things to be left out. One key factor though was something mentioned in the end of the SS arc. That being previous Substitue Shinigami. What happened to them? As a major character is seen with a Substitute Shinigami badge, it is most likely that we shall finially learn of their fate. If you are anxious to see your favorite Shinigami again, then you mighht have to wait.

These newer characters include Ichigo's boss Unagiya Ikumi who seems to be a regular human and the important group known as 'Xcution'. It's leader is Ginjo Kugo who is a neutral character that you can't be sure what his game is. At the moment, you don't know what everyone's motives are and what people are planning, but it seems Kubo is planning things out.You actually feel a lot like Ichigo as you read as you don't know what is really happening. People are being attacked, certain people aren't around, and Ichigo is in a lot of heated panic. What will happen? I don't know. It's refreshing in a way that Bleach is back to it's original starting point where you are unfamiliar with this new saga of sorts.Those that aren't patient or just can't handle how much Bleach chapters can drag (yes it gets to me too) then you should probably read something else. However if you can handle short chapters that build suspense, then this would be right for you.

Phew! Maybe we will get to see the Soul Reaper captains again afterall! Woot! (hide spoiler)]Bleach, Volume 49: The Lost Agent begins 17 months after Ichigo recovered from his battle with Aizen, and he is still coping with his newfound "normal" life. All of the Karakura gang have matured with most of them now being employed. Although the characters are older, the feel of this volume brought me back to the very beginning of the series. It has the same kind of silliness with the electricity of excitement from new characters and mysteries.This volume starts "The Lost Agent" story arc and introduces a gaggle of new characters. We meet Ichigo\'s crazy new boss, and a mysterious stranger with X-Men type powers and his gang of friends with similar powers. The formula is similar to the Soul Society story arc, but it feels fresh. I\'m really excited to see where Tite Kubo goes with these new characters. As long as he brings back a few old favorites, I\'m giddy in anticipation.I\'m so happy the silliness is back. Orihime and Isshin are as goofy as they were in the beginning of the series. This is making me fall in love with Bleach all over again. The last few volumes didn\'t leave me dying to run out to read the next volume, but this one is definitely stirring that desire in me! I\'m looking forward to see what\'s up with Chad and what is in store for Ichigo.Favorite Characters ... so far:* Byakuya Kuchiki* Renji Abarai* Isshin Kurosaki* Kisuke Urahara* Ichigo Kurosaki* J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake* Kenpachi Zaraki* Grimmjow Jaegerjaques* Ulquiorra Cifer* Yoruichi Shih\u014din* The Vizards (especially Shinji)* Sajin Komamura* The Great Desert Bros.

(hide spoiler)]\n', u"\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           First of all, the cover. Ichigo is very hot on this cover, what with all the extra shading and the cool serious look. As cliche and fangirly as this sounds, I really want an enlarged poster of this picture of Ichigo. :3Another thing that is related but then again not related to the specific volume is that I absolutely hate time skips. I had to have a big 7 year long time skip in Fairy Tail, so I was not happy to learn that there was also another one in this series too. Even if it is just a year, it's so annoying to look at a character and almost not recognize them because they have a different hairdo. -_-Ichigo is probably the only person who's hair stayed the same, which is good because after that whole trauma with the long black hair I would probably mentally kill him. We now see how Ichigo would be living if he never had Spirit energy, and shockingly (to me) he is actually quite content with his normal life. Although this sounds like peer pressure, if all my friends and family are involved with the spiritual world and beings, I would want to be involved too. Living for over a year and not seeing any ghosts would make me feel like I'm missing out on something and I'd practically go crazy.Ichigo seems to get on everyone's nerves, (like usual) except his close friends, and even his boss had to kidnap him to get him to work. He meets a strange man named Kugo Ginjo, who is human but can manipulate the soul's of inanimate objects. Hm. This volume made me laugh very hard, and I figured that this would be one of the easy-going, humorous volumes, until Ury\xfb gets catastrophically injured by Kugo, (but no one knew that), and Kugo convinces Ichigo to meet up with him for some explanations. For some reason he wants to help Ichigo get his Soul Reaper powers back, (don't know how well that will blow over though, now seeing how happy Ichigo is with a normal life), and then suddenly Chad appears! O.oAnd he has a kinda scruffy face... o-oEveryone is suddenly calling Chad, Sado, and I know that's his real name but I prefer the nickname Chad. ^.^Although this is all exciting and interesting, but I want to know what happened to the people we haven't seen for a while. For example: Nel, (and Pesche and Dondochakka), the Visoreds, some of the Soul Reapers like Renji, and I want to hear what some people think about Ichigo like Chizuru. She probably doesn't understand any of it anyway...That's a little weird too, that all of Ichigo's friends would take the information of Ichigo being a former Soul Reaper wouldn't bother them at all, and they wouldn't have questions.Huh, oh well. People have different relationships for friendships than me, so I guess it's normal for them to be cool with anything.Even Karin didn't bring anything up to Ichigo again, and before she was screaming at him for info. :/Maybe I'll see all those people in the next volume...? Probably not. :(\n         ", u'\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           It\u2019s hard to go back to the beginning but this volume does an admirable job of it. Ichigo and his friends are back in Karakura town and are starting their senior year in high school. It\u2019s been so long that it\u2019s easy to forget they are young teens. It was nice to see them doing things young people do. Now for spoilers. If you haven\u2019t read the previous volume, you can skip this review with the idea you\u2019ll have something to look forward to.Ichigo lost his Soul Reaper powers at the end of volume 48. It\u2019s been seventeen months since then. Uryu has been dealing with any Hollows while Ichigo settles back into school and home life. His sister, Karin\u2019s spiritual powers are growing and his relationship to her and Yuzu seems strained almost to the breaking point.A chance encounter begins the new arc. Ichigo helps a stranger and what looks like mere chance is really a set up for a man name Ginjo and his companions. They want Ichigo. Ginjo drops veiled hints about Ichigo\u2019s father and family getting the young man on his hook. All we know is Ginjo\u2019s group wants Ichigo to regain his Soul Reaper powers but why we don\u2019t know. Also something has attacked and nearly killed Uryu and Orihime and Chad could be next. And how does Urahara tie into this? We\u2019ll have to read on. Personally I liked it. I like that the characters did seem older as far as the artwork was concerned. It\u2019s nearly a year and a half time jump so that was good. I would have liked more of how Ichigo struggled post-losing his powers but that would have probably slowed the plot (and we can probably see hints of that down the road). This volume concentrated on story telling for a change and there are almost no fight scenes. That was kinda nice. I guess I\u2019ll be reading on.\n'], 0]!!!![u'14432070', u"Globe Literature Teacher's Resource Book: Purple Level", u' ', u'\n23957\nGlobe Fearon\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23957.Globe_Fearon\n3.75\n117\n15\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'23253700', u'Muistomerkki', u'93', u'\n16070\nAlexander Pushkin\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1207346296p5/16070.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1207346296p2/16070.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16070.Alexander_Pushkin\n4.08\n104231\n3108\n', u'1999', u'', u'', u'WSOY', u'Kun Pu\u0161kin ilmestyi hurmaamaan ven\xe4l\xe4ist\xe4 yleis\xf6\xe4 1800-luvun alussa, h\xe4nt\xe4 pidettiin puhtaan runouden satakielen\xe4.

Stranded without her surgical team less than 500 feet from the front lines she encounters a wounded English soldier, the almost inappropriately courteous Lieutenant Robert Fitzgerald. With his help, she saves the life of a grievously wounded man, but in the press of new casualties, he slips away before she has time to thank him. As the long days pass, she realizes that the hands of that man, for a little while, brought salvation instead of savagery."A truly remarkable historical novel- so finely rendered in period detail - that the reader becomes one with the plot and characters.Mr. Griffis has a superb talent for capturing the small details that make up the whole- from the horrors of war to the very intricit procedures involved with early 20th Century Wartime medicine.Charlotte Braninov is a very complex character, one who is beautifully drawn by the pen of Mr. Griffis. Her conflicting feelings on war and her intense emotions sparked by her time treating Lieutenant Robert Fitzgerald left me breathless- they were so emotionally powerful. All of the secondary characters are also so very well written, and the atmosphere created by the excellent prose is to be praised! This is a novel that will not only entertain and inform, but pull at your emotions as well- a truly beautiful novel set during a horric time in history.AN OFFICIAL JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB MUST READRICK FRIEDMANFOUNDERTHE JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB\n         ', u"\n           \n           By The Hands Of Men (Book 1: The Old World) told an amazing story. I have always loved history, but with it comes pain, war, death, hope, and sometimes even love. This story gives you all of these things.Charlotte and Robert meet amongst the battlefield. They then find themselves forming a bond while working together in the field hospital during World War 1. He is a soldier and she is a nurse. Any relationship between them is forbidden, but they seem to find a peace together. One that is hard to come by in a world torn apart by the death of men and women all around them. Near the end they become separated by thousands of miles. But their love is still there and very real.This book told a sad tale of the war. The world and the people are literally torn apart. Mentally and physically they fight against the horrors. This story brought many tears to my eyes. These types of books normally do. It was so good and so descriptive that at times it's like I was standing in Charlotte's place amongst the broken men and amongst the battlefield. That is what makes a good book. And this was better than good. It was intriguing and powerful. It was a work of art. It painted a picture in my mind, a sad one, but true and colorful, all the same. I look forward to reading the next book in this series....Stormihttp://www.boundlessbookreviews.comhttps://www.facebook.com/BBReviews\n"], 0]!!!![u'20827964', u'Richard Scarry\u2019s Busytown\u2122 - Early Learning Essentials Bulletin Board Set', u'8', u'\n1000834\nNOT A BOOK\nCompilation\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1000834.NOT_A_BOOK\n4.06\n52063\n4623\n', u'2011', u'1', u'3', u'Carson-Dellosa Publishing', u'<b>Teach early learning essential skills with <i>Richard Scarry\'s Busytown</i>\u2122 vintage art!</b> This basic skills bulletin board set includes:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />6 charts (17" x 24" each): Numbers 1-20, Alphabet, Shapes, Months of the Year, Happy Birthday, and Colors<br /><br />A Welcome chart<br /><br />A We Love Reading! chart<br /><br />A resource guide<br /><br /><br /><br />\u2122 &amp; \xa9 2011 The Richard Scarry Corporation', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'34066130', u'The No-Salt Cookbook: Reduce or Eliminate Salt Without Sacrificing Flavor', u' ', u'\n1856\nDavid C.

They have their disagreements and quibbles, but they still stay true to each other and to themselves. Such is the case with Jack and Dulcinea in A Thoroughly Compromised Lady. They stole my heart early and never once broke it.Dulci is the toast of the season - actually, she has been for several seasons after making the decision to never marry to retain the freedom she\u2019s got being the sister of an earl. She enjoys the witty banter and innuendo exchanged with Jack, Viscount Wainsbridge - something the ton enjoys just as much. They\u2019ve known each other forever and Dulci\u2019s feelings for the man have grown over the years, but his job with the Crown takes him away for unknown periods of time, usually at all the wrong times. Dulci is a fascinating woman, into history and fencing - more reasons to keep her atypical freedom.Vowing to never marry because he knows a marriage would never last due to the frequency the King needs his services, Jack continues to do his duty while looking forward to his verbal dueling with Dulci when he\u2019s in London. As much as he\u2019d like more with her, his best friend, Dulci\u2019s brother, would kill him for taking advantage. But when he\u2019s given his next assignment, she\u2019s right in the middle of it with South American artifacts that include a hidden forged map that could start a war between England and Venezuela. Figuring out what it all means, Dulci refuses to stay in the background where it\u2019s safe, much to Jack\u2019s frustration.When the villain learns Dulci has his map, he takes no prisoners in his haste and greed to get what he wants. Jack is sly and a step ahead, so he and Dulci escape to South America to clear Jack\u2019s name against fraudulent accusations and to reaffirm English claim to British Guiana. It\u2019s the adventure of a lifetime for Dulci and she takes to it like a duck to water, even despite the danger. She keeps her head when that danger does hit, and she does the same when it comes to confronting Jack with her feelings as well as his.Even at the end Jack tries to protect Dulci, and I wanted to shake him silly! He acknowledges she\u2019s the perfect partner for him, but he can\u2019t get past something happening to her. He\u2019d rather die than have that happen. It takes facing natives with their own laws to bring home how life without her would be. I like their honesty with each other, even in dire circumstances. They\u2019re an intriguing couple, and I had fun with them and enjoyed them immensely.As an aside, though I like the cover of this book, I\u2019m a tad disappointed Harlequin has stepped away from the plate when in comes to Ms. Scott\u2019s books. Her previous covers have been different and simply a lot of fun, Pickpocket Countess being my favorite. That cover tells the story before you even start reading. I think the art department could have had a bit more of a good time with Jack and Dulcinea.I always enjoy Ms. Scott\u2019s action and mystery as well as her characters and storylines in her books. She pulls you into the story quickly, plays on your emotions frequently, and keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end. A Thoroughly Compromised Lady is a very satisfying read.See my complete review at http://www.goodbadandunread.com\n', u"\n           \n           Historical English titled society romance with a popular young lady, Lady Dulci Wycroft that has been very choosy about a husband to the point where she has almost given up on the whole business. Newly titled Viscount Wainsbridge, just plain Jack has been best friends with Dulci's older brother Brandon since childhood and he watched Dulci grow up into a beautiful spirited high society lady. Dulci and Jack are famous for their witty banter at the society events. So they are very flirty but always with in society's bounds, until a hot secret kiss during the recent holiday season. So Dulci knows that Jack has a secret position as the King's adviser so he knows how to keep a secret, so he is perfect person to learn about sexy time because no one will ever know... So starts Dulci's bad ideas.Dulci knows what she wants, but doesn't understand Jack so there is some serious hot and cold moments between the two of them. I almost could believe that Dulci would get away with having a lover before getting married, I'm sure there are quite a few well born ladies that came to the marriage bed with more then a little bit of experience but with some important fathers, huge dowries and noble birthrights (or all three), the husbands take what they can get.We get the mystery of the forged map to push our couple and the story forward as well as a boat trip and an Amazon adventure through the wilds with wild men.There was almost too much story in this book, but there would have to be to explain the turn around about love and marriage which happens to Jack because Dulci (like most women) knew what she wanted quicky.288 pages2 and half stars\n         "], 0]!!!![u'16197198', u'A Violinist&apos;s Tale', u'132', u'\n6599116\nElliot Magaziner\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6599116.Elliot_Magaziner\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2012', u'8', u'1', u'Aventine Press', u"The story of Elliot Magaziner's life is of his passion and talent as a violinist.

I like to catch the inspiration of your bright looks, to hear your sweet voices, and to watch the lightness of your feet as you flit along over the country roads or village pavements, or the thronged avenues of our great towns. <br />You are schoolgirls, and you are told every day by grown people that you are living your happiest days.

Something weird is happening and, unusual enough for her, she needs to find out why. But when people start falling into a coma with no reason, among them Dafne's sister, she decides to take the matter in her hands, because if her intuition is right, this isn't something doctors or virologists can fight. This is something\u2026more.<br /><br />With frustration and guilt leading her way, and Ian forcing himself to her side, Dafne will step onto a road that'll open her eyes to why ignorance is bliss, why hate is so close to love, and why our imagination might be the most dangerous weapon ever known.", u'3408', u'3.77', u'563', [(u'to-read', 1202)], [u'\n           \n           Good news for everyone: there are no vampires, no werewolves, no mermaids, no fairies, no shifters, no zombies, and no fallen angels.

This book grabs you from the beginning and whisks you breathlessly all the way to the end. This is a read that you will have a hard time putting down. The characters are fully developed and so lovable. Tatiana Vila is definitely one of my new favorite authors. Between reading Break Away and The Ylem, I will be waiting with baited breath for the next books of both of these!

The character descriptions in this book were good and you really got to know everyone in the story. The humour was excellent and I laughed at the Dafne\u2019s sarcasm. Dafne the main character in this story is known as the Ice Queen to everyone in town and most people stay far away from her as she does have a temper. Losing both of her parents has hardened Dafne and there is no one she cares in this world more than her twin sister Buffy. Now Buffy\u2019s boyfriend is another story; Ian loves to push Dafne\u2019s buttons and they spend all their time arguing and I think right here you know there is something more going on here. During school Dafne notices changes in her classmates, they seem to be walking around in a trance like state and their eyes are glazed over. Now people are falling into comas and not till Buffy is affect by this does Dafne know in her gut that something is not right. Dafne and Ian will team up to figure out what is happening to everyone and how can an unknown virus be the cause of this. Dafne has to use all her inner strength to fight this battle and knows she has to open herself up. And we do get to see Dafne become a better person.The paranormal part of this book is unique and I did enjoy it the idea behind it. I rated the book 3 stars because I did enjoy parts of the story and I may continue on with the next book in this series just to catch up with Dafne and Ian.\n', u"\n           \n           I read this book as part of read2review with PNR&UF Fanatics group. Thanks to Tatiana and the moderators for this chance to read this book!I really enjoyed this book. It was completely original. I don't think I have heard of anything like this world which is really great. The reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because I liked the Ylem better. There was just something about this book that I didn't connect with.I wish more time had been spent in describing how the human world related to the other world that is in this story. I'm sure this will probably be addressed in later books in this series, but I wished we had seen more of it here. That is really my only complaint.Once again Tatiana Vila created a story that held my interest the entire way through.

It wasn't a bad book and the things I didn't like were more personal and may not bother other readers. The characters were well developed ad the story was original, but something bugged me. First let me say the the book moved entirely too slow for me. I found myself skimming which isnt a good sign, then I would have to go back and re-read when I realized I missed something. But mostly I didn't like his one because, (view spoiler)[ I got the impression early on that Dafne and her twin sister's boyfriend Ian were going to hook up. That bothered me and maybe why the story lost its luster for me early on.  (hide spoiler)]. It's late for me, so I will revise this review tomorrow when I've had time to think about it more.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'31462246', u'Home: Its Joys and Its Sorrows: A Domestic Tale', u'108', u'\n14453335\nUncle Author\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14453335.Uncle_Author\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'5', u'20', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Five years later, Anna has just learned the her employers are in financial trouble and she may lose her job, which will mean she will have difficulty providing for her daughter.

He realises that he feels the needs to apologise for the way he left her but his attempts to talk to Anna do not get very far. Anna doesn't know how to tell him that her daughter is his, and is especially worried about what his reaction might be.This is very much a slow burning story, but I enjoyed it. One thing that is common in Maggie Cox's books is that there is always an aura of sadness about them, and that is the case here but it is not as all consuming as some of her other books.I really enjoyed the opening scene, reading how and why the characters meet and connect.

He doesn't question the paternity of the child and immediately plans their future together. The story was a bit weak but it was an easy and enjoyable read. Would I read it again? Dunno. It's not a book that will stay with you.

There is a sadness and melancholy in her books that I find endearing. Hero is not typical cruel or alpha male. He is sad, brooding and tortured. He spends one passionate night with Anna a shy girl that works in the hotel he is staying at. The next day Anna realizes her handsome stranger has fled! Years later Anna is the mother of Tia, a sweet 4 year old girl and Dante is the business man who will take charge of the hotel she works in. When he realizes Anna's daughter is his, he is shocked and determined to have them back in his life. He wants a new start for himself and his family but he doesn't believe he deserves Anna's love. He feels unworthy and is self deprecating and vulnerable. Anna is afraid of commitment and even though it's obvious she adores Dante she is not sure marriage to him is a good idea. She knows Dante is a wonderful man but she has some daddy issues and so she is wary. Dante on the other hand wants Anna to accept him for himself and not hold his past against him. He wants to win her trust and her heart and he won't give up until he does so! Swoon worthy hero, sweet heroine and adorable baby girl. Epilogue was cuteness overload, their marriage scene with their daughter is super hilarious! Another great love story by Maggie Cox. \n         ", u'\nI loved it!

Enamored of bats ever since discovering a colony in a cave as a boy, Tuttle saw how effective photography could be in persuading people not to fear bats, and he has spent his career traveling the world to document them.Few people realize how sophisticated and intelligent bats are. Tuttle shares research showing that frog-eating bats can identify frogs by their calls, that vampire bats have a social order similar to that of primates, and that bats have remarkable memories. Bats also provide enormous benefits by eating crop pests, pollinating plants, and carrying seeds needed for reforestation. They save farmers billions of dollars annually and are essential to a healthy planet.Sharing highlights from a lifetime of adventure and discovery, Tuttle takes us to the frontiers of bat research and conservation and forever changes the way we see these poorly understood yet fascinating creatures."', u'787', u'4.31', u'240', [(u'to-read', 447)], [u'\n           \n           DNFspent more time on his life over the bats\n         ', u"\n           \n           Here in Austin, Texas, we already know bats are awesome. Our 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats consume thousands of tons of insects a night--including agricultural pests--and their nightly flight from Congress Street Bridge is so complex and beautiful as to Austin a hot spot for eco-tourism, generating money for our city. And we have Merlin Tuttle and his advocacy organization Bat Conservation International for paving the way for our enviro-civic pride. THE SECRET LIVES OF BATS is not only part memoir and part nature document, it's also part advocacy manual. Tuttle recounts his decades of bat research and photography, resulting in numerous discoveries about the complex ways bats interact with nature and drive the evolutions of various plant and animal species--we have no idea the benefits we enjoy just by being near bats! And that's a problem because for every narrow escape from a cobra or charging elephant in the name of bat research, Tuttle has come face to face with more farmers, families, hunters, and the like who are ignorant about our flying mammalian friends, often with devastating consequences for local bat colonies. But Tuttle understands that advocacy is education plus diplomacy, meeting people on their own territory and addressing their concerns with empathy, delicacy, and knowledge. Thank you, Merlin Tuttle! BATS!\n         ", u'\n           \n           I have been a fan of bats ever since one got in the house one night and I had to get it out. While my boyfriend at the time overreacted and wanted to kill it, I managed to remove him from the bedroom where I had the bat contained, and I simply opened windows and took screens out so it could eventually fly out. I had an opportunity to observe this little creature and it was simply very cool! We lived in a rented reconverted barn where there were lots of these creatures in the attic. At night I could leave the doors open and not have a bug come in thanks to their industriousness. From that point on, I have been a huge fan of bats because they are such great neighbors! This book confirmed that my feelings for bats have not been misplaced. They control pests (bugs) and pollinate many plants. They are simply wonderful creatures! \n         ', u"\n           \n           I ended up enjoying this quite a bit, although Tuttle is not the most dynamic writer. That's a minor quibble on my part, though. The book is well done and where Tuttle is lacking in narrative chops he gets by on the strength of his stories, some of which are really a lot of fun. Aside from the kind of hair-raising escapades you'd expect from stalking bats in the wild, he has some really interesting tales of how he got some of his iconic photos, plus general bat lore (which I for one am quite into). Apparently they're very intelligent and kind of affable\u2014most of them are very easy to tame (he gets a lot of shots by recreating scenes from the wild in studios he sets up, and takes a few days to get the bats used to taking food out of his hands so they're not freaked out when it's time for their close-ups sipping from some rare cactus flower). Tuttle definitely conveys the sheer coolness of bats, though there's a certain sameness to the tone of his stories that flattens them out a bit. Still, the content made it worth the read, and if you weren't a bat fan before, this book could definitely turn you.\n         ", u"\n           \n           The Secret Lives of Bats: My Adventures with the World's Most Misunderstood Mammals, is a wonderful book. I have recommended this delightful and informative adventure story to everyone.Merlin Tuttle is a great storyteller and a fount of knowledge on bats. He is open, honest and charming as he relates the remarkable history of his life as a bat enthusiast. Having studied bats for more than fifty years, his passion and love for these creatures is evident. He started Bat Conservation International back in 1982. Tuttle, one of the foremost educators in this field, is a dedicated scientist, and ecologist. He is a heck of a terrific human being. There is no self indulgence in this charmingly related history of Merlin Tuttle's lifelong love of bats. Rather it is funny, fun and informative. If you know little about bats you will love learning lots with Tuttle as your teacher! If you like animal stories, such as those by Durrell, Mowat, and Herriot, this book's perspective will pull you right in. If you love adventure, close encounters with danger, tons of fun, and even scares with wild and woolly tales of moonshiners and other offbeat sorts, come along for the ride. This compassionate teacher will open to you all of the beauty and all that is fine about our own species as well as bats. The years it spans add to the flavor of the book, as the author learns from childhood about bats and their nature. You are given amazing, evolving insight into the secret world of bats from start to finish.Ultimately you will be moved by the nobility of this book. People seem to bring out the best in each other, united in their fascination with Tuttle's love for bats. It is a delight.This a positive story which is real, fun and true. It is very educational as well. The Secret Lives of Bats: My Adventures with the World's Most Misunderstood Mammals is an upbeat gem from a great nature writer.There is something enduring about The Secret Lives of Bats which everyone who reads it will adore.Bats are beautiful to me now, thanks to Merlin Tuttle.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'25373200', u'Mortgage Valuation Models: Embedded Options, Risk, and Uncertainty (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)', u' ', u'\n1330595\nAndrew  Davidson\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1330595.Andrew_Davidson\n3.82\n78\n12\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u"Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are among the most complex of all financial instruments. Analysis of MBS requires blending empirical analysis of borrower behavior with the mathematical modeling of interest rates and home prices. Over the past 25 years, Andrew Davidson and Alexander Levin have been at the leading edge of MBS valuation and risk analysis. <br /> Mortgage Valuation Models: Embedded Options, Risk, and Uncertainty contains a detailed description of the sophisticated theories and advanced methods that the authors employ in real-world analyses of mortgage-backed securities. Issues such as complexity, borrower options, uncertainty, and model risk play a central role in the authors' approach to the valuation of MBS. The coverage spans the range of mortgage products from loans and TBA (to-be-announced) pass-through securities to subordinate tranches of subprime-mortgage securitizations. With reference to the classical CAPM and APT, the book advocates extending the concept of risk-neutrality to modeling home prices and borrower options, well beyond interest rates. It describes valuation methods for both agency and non-agency MBS including pricing new loans; approaches to prudent risk measurement, ranking, and decomposition; and methods for modeling prepayments and defaults of borrowers.<br /> The authors also reveal quantitative causes of the 2007-09 financial crisis and provide insight into the future of the U.S. housing finance system and mortgage modeling as this field continues to evolve.

How do you talk about a book which seems to either redefine or cause to shrivel all the normal descriptors one attaches to works of fiction? I mean, strictly speaking, you\'d have to call this an epic fantasy, I suppose. Wait! You didn\'t let me finish. Because that\'s not it, not really. I mean, it\'s not really just epic, because it actually seems to encompass the whole damn world, to cover all of time, kind of. And it\'s more of an occult novel than a fantasy novel, if anything, I guess. I mean, it\'s a real story, set in real-life New York, partly upstate and partly in our big bad city. It just sort of so happens that, well, everyone in the story is part of the Tale, which only some of them can understand, an no one can predict, not really. See, now wait again! Because now you\'ll think it\'s some big silly meta thing, which it is not not not. Look. Little, Big is a novel about a family. For real this time. It\'s about Smoky Barnable, our earnest, humble, erstwhile sometimes-hero. Smoky meets and falls in love with one of the most beautiful characters I have ever had the pleasure of traveling five-hundred-odd pages with, Daily Alice. Daily Alice lives in Edgewood, which is in upstate New York, and the book opens with Smoky making the trek upstate for his wedding. He has been given a series of inexplicable instructions (walk don\'t ride, wear clothing borrowed not bought, etc.), which he is doing his best to follow, though he doesn\'t understand why he must. He must because it is part of the Tale. He has been promised to Daily Alice, kind of, maybe, or well, someone has been promised to her anyway, and she hopes it\'s him, but she has already decided that she will have him anyway, she loves him that much, even if he is not the one promised.This is a taste of the world you step into in Little, Big, which goes on to follow Smoky and Alice and their families and their neighbors and their children and some of those children\'s children too, for four generations, backwards and forwards. It may well be a fantasy, but it is done with such a light touch, with such subtle mentions of fairies and talking fish and worlds within worlds, that you could easily miss or dismiss them, you could write them off as the magic-belief of children, or the ramblings of old women who have spent too long abed. And I haven\'t even told you this yet, as this review draws longer and appallingly longer: John Crowley could have spent all five hundred pages just describing a single tree, and I would have followed him along every goddamn branch. Which is to say, this book is suffused, constantly and shockingly, with some of the most astonishingly beautiful prose I have ever read \u2013 equally as stunning when describing twilight falling over the City or the endless quest for love.Here are some other wonderful things about this book: * In the City, the true oracles are the bums who lurk on the subway in broken shoes muttering to themselves. * At one point a maybe-fake, maybe-evil baby (who eats live coals) is blown up.* The only tie to the world of \'them\' \u2013 the creatures who may or may not know how the Tale will come out \u2013 is a deck of pseudo-Tarot cards, the reading of which takes at least an entire lifetime to begin to understand. * Included are some of the most powerful, most potent descriptions of taking hallucinogenic drugs that I have ever read (and that\'s not even what\'s happening in the story).* Did I mention the dialogue? It is so good, so true, so utterly believable. * This book made me \u2013 a sworn cynic, a jaded literary snob, a snarky bitch who doesn\'t even know what \'sentiment\' means any longer \u2013 cry, several times. * Everyone in the book is named for nature: Violet Bramble, John Drinkwater, Marge Juniper, Mrs. Underhill, George Mouse, Lilac, the Rooks, the Dales, and on and on. And now look. Because I know that I have done a woefully inadequate job of making you see, I am going to here transcribe a long-ish passage from the book. This takes place very early on, when Smoky and Daily Alice are still just falling in love. She is telling him about a time when she was walking in the woods just after a storm and saw a rainbow off in the distance. "It was a rainbow, but bright, and it looked like it came down just \u2013 there, you know, not far; I could see the grass, all sparkling and stained every color there. The sky had got big, you know, the way it does when it clears at last after a long rainy time, and everything looked near; the place the rainbow came down was near; and I wanted more than anything to go and stand in it \u2013 and look up \u2013 and be covered with colors." Smoky laughed. "That\'s hard," he said. She laughed too, dipping her head and raising the back of her hand to her mouth in a way that already seemed heartstirringly familiar to him. "It sure is," she said. "It seemed to take forever." "You mean you \u2013 " "Every time you thought you were coming close, it would be just as far off, in a different place; and if you came to that place, it would be in the place you came from; and my throat was sore with running, and not getting any closer. But you know what you do then \u2013 " "Walk away from it," he said, surprised at his own voice but Somehow sure this was the answer. "Sure. That isn\'t as easy as it sounds, but \u2013 " "No, I don\'t suppose." He had stopped laughing. " \u2013 but if you do it right \u2013 " "No, wait," he said. " \u2013 just right, then . . . " "They don\'t really come down, now," Smoky said. "They don\'t, not really." "They don\'t here," she said. "Now listen, I followed my dog Spark; I let him choose, because he didn\'t care, and I did. It took just one step, and turn around, and guess what." "I can\'t guess. You were covered in colors." "No. It\'s not like that. Outside, you see colors inside it; so, inside it \u2013 " "You see colors outside it." "Yes. The whole world colored, as though it were made of candy \u2013 no, like it was made of a rainbow. A whole colored world as soft as light all around as far as you can see. You want to run and explore it. But you don\'t dare take a step, because it might be the wrong step \u2013 so you only look, and look. And you think: Here I am at last." She had fallen into thought. "At last," she said again softly. See? See? They\'re just ordinary people, to whom (maybe? maybe not?) extraordinary events are always happening.Well anyway there you are. If I can\'t convert you, and Mr. Crowley himself can\'t convert you, then you are just unconvertable and I\'m done trying. But if you are even the tiniest bit intrigued by my very long, rambling, adulatory speech here, please, I beseech you, go get this amazing, astonishing, riveting, spectacular book. It really will blow your mind. It did mine. \n         ', u'\n           \n           This book astounded me. Not in a good way. I expected to like "Little, Big" quite a bit from what I\'d heard about it. But, like the Drinkwater house, it looks smaller on the outside than it feels from inside. Not in a good way. I mean the book feels like it\'s a thousand pages.Some people like it, as you can tell by other reviews: the language is often quite clever, it ends on a semi-strong note, and it plays with myth in some interesting ways. These are all good things. Bad things? Well, the characters aren\'t compelling, the clever language is often stilted and ponderously slow, and almost nothing happens. On top of that, the fantastical aspects of this book were never surprising or especially interesting.When it comes to the characters, we run through four generations in about 600 pages. This gives us slightly more than a hundred pages per generation to get to know the characters, and Crowley clearly needs more pages than that to make them interesting. Only in the last of the four generations did I like any of them (Auberon and Sylvie). Before that, the motives of the characters were sketchy at best, and it didn\'t feel like any of the characters were DOING anything; they were waiting for something to happen. As a reader, I was doing the same thing. Okay, here\'s the plot. A man marries into a family that lives in a gigantic, mysterious house in Edgewood. For generations, this family has been interacting in various strange ways with the Faerie folk that live in the forest around them. The family is part of a great Story, and they don\'t know quite what this story is going to be. Some members of the family come into direct contact with the fae, while others yearn to see them and are never able to. A few live lives of tragedy as a result of this proximity with the mythic side of reality, while others live semi-normal lives. Being part of a grand Story? Having a Destiny? These are meaningless designations unless it ends up BEING a grand story. Or unless it feels like a destiny is reached. You can\'t entertain me by assuring me these people are Living Some Grand Story, when I can see clearly that Nothing is Happening. They\'re all hanging out at a house in the woods, going through the process of forgetting about their connection to the faerie realm because they believe this is the only safe thing for the family. Then, finally on page 450 or so, it looks like there\'s GONNA be a plot. The kind of plot where stuff is going to happen. But don\'t worry: it\'s a false alarm. Things DO happen, but they\'re safely off-screen and vague. Then the end pops up predictably and....well, bleck. How else could it have ended? I mean, did anyone NOT know it would end this way? And is the ending crafted in a way that\'s especially insightful?Let me be honest about something, though: I don\'t like generation-spanning fiction. Pick the generation that is interesting and focus in, don\'t give me 400 pages of background about the people who won\'t be involved in whatever climax you\'ve cooked up. If someone isn\'t even alive during your story\'s climax, then why do you think it\'s a good idea to tell me about them?But if these characters had come to life for me, I would\'ve probably still enjoyed the book. Unfortunately, at all of the most dramatic moments of the story, characters did things that seemed to come out of the blue. Why did this married guy and this woman suddenly have an affair? No idea. Why did his wife react the way she did? No idea. I was supposed to be intrigued by all of this I suppose, but it felt flat to me because of my lack of interest in the characters. Crowley reimagines myth in a way that is often vivid but never surprising, and that\'s unfortunately the strongest part of this book. In sum, I don\'t recommend it. \n         ', u"\n           \n           sometimes, when dreaming, i am aware of a complex and mysterious history to the at times strange but often mundane narrative of the dream itsef. i'll be running away from something, against some dark background, a house or castle or a school, who knows... although the drama of running is clear, there's often a feeling that so many things have already happened before i started running, things of which i'm only dimly aware, a whole story has happened or is happening in which i'm only getting bits & pieces or what feels like the end. i guess it's what makes some dreams so hard to explain - simple or inexplicable events occurring that have an emotional depth and meaning that is near impossible to describe in passionless terms. other times, passing by my work's drop-in center, i'll exchange words with a visitor, a person usually dealing with life changes or the possibility of life ending (that's the nature of my workplace). they'll say some simple pleasantry or even give a brief phrase to show how they're doing... and there's a whole world in what they say, an entire journey expressed, nearly intangible emotions conveyed. but of the details of that history, the why and how of it, and the place they seek or the place they fear to go... inexpressible.that's what reading Little, Big was like for me. so many little moments in a family's life, in the lives of people connected to that family, in the city in where the family lives. and all these moments live in a world with a background and a future that is vast, mystical, dreamlike, one that cannot be expressed with any kind of logical or linear description. sometimes the moments are so personal and delicate... other times they are whimsical and brimming with magic, or strange and full of some kind of barely understandable threat... sad moments, and tragic ones, and moments filled with delight... and in the end, they become grand and they sweep the characters and the reader towards what almost feels like an understanding of the purpose and destination of it all. almost!the novel is about an enchanted family, their loves & lives & history. it is also about the end of an age, the beginning of another, witches & changelings & fairies & enchantments, loneliness & forgetfulness & sorrow, love, the past and the future, and new york city. there are no real villains, there are no traditional heroes. the writing has a dense but fragile beauty. there are layers upon layers. there are mythical beings that come alive and realistic characters that become as myths. i sighed in amazement, many times, at the wonder of it all; it is like a dream made half-real. it is a unique book.\n         ", u'\nIllustration: Peter Milton | http://ow.ly/U0izq En un momento de silencio se miraron simplemente el uno al otro y la verdad zumb\xf3, tron\xf3 dentro de \xe9l cuando comprendi\xf3 de pronto lo que hab\xeda sucedido: no s\xf3lo \xe9l se hab\xeda enamorado de ella, y a primera vista, sino que ella a primera vista se hab\xeda enamorado de \xe9l, y las dos circunstancias produc\xedan ese efecto: el de empezar a curar su anonimato.

When I finished it, I immediately felt like re-reading it to catch everything that I might have missed. It's one of the saddest books I've ever read and is simultaneously one of the most uplifting.

In 2010, he began offering his artisanal service to the world, to the jubilation of artists, writers, draftsmen, and standardized test takers. <br />Now, Rees presents a book that is both a manifesto and a fully-illustrated walk-through of the many, many, many ways to sharpen a pencil. Including chapters on equipment, current practice, and modern technologies, it also points at new trends in sharpening, including "Celebrity Impression Pencil Sharpening (CIPS)," a warning about the "Psychological Risks Associated with Pencil Sharpening," and a survey of "Wines that tastes like pencils." <br />As Rees implores: "Sharpening pencils should be an activity that enriches the senses." <br />And if you think it\'s a joke, why don\'t you poke yourself with your newly sharpened pencil?

It is quite literally a guide on how to sharpen pencils, with a heavy dose of surrealism.

It is no doubt due to the fact that every piece of art which has individuality and real likeness to the scenes and character it is intended to depict is done in a kind of trance. The author, in effect, self-hypnotises himself, has created an atmosphere which is separate and apart from that of his daily surroundings, and by virtue of his imagination becomes absorbed in that atmosphere.

She's a happy, enthusiastic, curious eighteen-year-old, and her travelling companion, the Xantish lieutenant Ket Du'kai, intrigues her with his stories of his homeland, Xan'tai, long since invaded by Aeberelle and absorbed into its empire. At the same time, he unsettles her by making her rethink certain assumptions.Averie is immediately captivated by Chiarrin and its capital, the port city of Chesza. While Lady Selkirk complains about the heat and the uncivilised ways of the locals, Averie embraces the culture, starts wearing the clothes of the region, and befriends a local girl and cloth trader, Jalessa, who teaches her about the ways of the city and its broken gods.Things are strained between her and Morgan, though, as they start to realise how different their perspectives are. Averie can empathise with the Chiarrizi rebels who are causing problems for the Aeberelle army, even when they bomb the marketplace. She constantly questions the right for Aeberelle to be there, to invade and take over merely because the country is in an excellent spot for trading with and invading other countries. Morgan is more serious and pragmatic, and is invested whole-heartedly in the army. The role of military wife is beginning to look much less desirable to Averie.Meanwhile, there is the very different and fascinating Ket Du'kai, to whom Averie feels increasingly drawn. As the city appears to settle down and accept its foreign rulers, Averie's life becomes more troubled - until everything culminates in one terrible night that will see her grow from silly girl to level-headed woman, and take charge of her own destiny.I love the colours on this cover, the green and blue, and the hint of exotic. Perhaps it's the wallpaper in the background, but I'm reminded of peacocks and the British in India. Which is very apt, actually. Perhaps the most eye-catching thing, though, is the author's name - I love the books by Shinn I've read, so when I saw this I just had to have it. I wasn't disappointed either.General Winston's Daughter joins a popular trend in books to identify women by their relationship to more successful or interesting men - The Time Traveler's Wife, The Pilot's Wife, The Shape-changer's Wife, The Abortionist's Daughter, The Memory-Keeper's Daughter are the ones that immediately spring to mind. They're slightly misleading, because we make those mental associations of woman + time traveller = woman is time traveller. Certainly sells well. Of those, I've only read The Time Traveler's Wife and The Shape-changer's Wife, so I'm not sure about the others, but in those both the time traveller and his wife and the shape-changer and his wife are equally important to the story. In General Winston's Daughter, the General is a very minor character.Shinn has shown before, with novels like Angel-seeker, how adept she is at incorporating our own history and current troubling events, as well as cultural and racial hatred, into her stories, making them timeless and perceptive. While General Winston's Daughter is easily linked to the old British Empire's colonialist expansion, it can just as easily refer to any other empire: French, Spanish, Roman, American. It is especially relevant as a critique against the still-persistent American desire for an empire and its invasion of countries like Iraq simply for their usefulness.The beautiful thing about General Winston's Daughter is how it portrays both sides, how through Averie's open-minded and understanding perspective we can sympathise with the Chiarizzi who only want to be free and defend themselves against invaders. Since we are the dominant cultures in our own world, the Aebrians are familiar and accessible, their motivations clear and understandable. There is no easy solution to the clash of agendas, but the simple act of exploring the situation, its impact and consequences, is possibly more important than the resolution.While the story is as confined as Averie, you get as much access and information about the land and its people as Averie does, which draws you closer to her. The tantalising glimpses of the culture and city are fascinating, with the meanings behind colour (blue and green mean you are engaged), the broken gods and the fierce, determined people.Written in a style similar to books like Shinn's The Shape-changer's Wife and Patricia McKillop's Alphabet of Thorn, both intimate and distant, not omniscient nor directly the voice of the main character, General Winston's Daughter has that gentle touch of observing without disturbing. A vague story-teller is our medium, one that controls the story and how much is revealed, lending it an almost old-fashioned feel and adds to that colonial atmosphere.Superbly written, General Winston's Daughter is an absolute gem. Well worth using in schools for the provoking issues it raises, incorporated so vividly with Averie's dying innocence and burgeoning maturity.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Sharon Shinn amazes me. Her worldbuilding is always intriguing; her imagery and her plot hooks are often well-worn to the point of being a little hokey, but the things she does with them are just incredible. General Winston's Daughter really surprised me. All the way through, it feels like just another spunky-heroine-comes-of-age book -- the kind of book I really enjoy, but not a standout in that class -- and then, right near the end, the plot twists in a way that actually changed how I think about the world.Read May 1, 2009; reread April 2, 2014.\n         ", u'\n           \n           My least favorite book that I\u2019ve read from Shinn so far. \xacI\u2019ve read quite a few of her books, both \u2018adult\u2019 and YA, and while she sometimes comes dangerously close to stepping off that romance cliff, and plunging into sentimentality, usually she hovers [happily] on the brink. However, here the romance was at the annoying level (even if the love triangle functioned more as a symbol of rejecting one culture and embracing the Oppressed, than an actual romance), and I also felt something I haven\u2019t felt in any of Shinn\u2019s other books: that it was written \u2018down\u2019 to a younger (teen girl) audience. I felt like the author said: \u201cHey! I\u2019m gonna sucker the tweens in with the promise of a romance, and then I\u2019m gonna hammer in some Important Points: Colonialism is BAD! Imperialism: AWFUL! Racism: NO GOOD! Oh yeah, and girls should stick up for themselves! GO GIRL!\u201dDon\u2019t get me wrong, I have nothing against books which show the conflicts and harm inherent in the maintenance of an empire. There\u2019s near-infinite potential for powerful stories there. But this story simplifies to the point of absurdity. The characters are all one-dimensional (which also makes Our Heroine, Averie\u2019s main romantic decision conflict-less and unsurprising), and Averie is naive to a degree that beggars belief. (But of course, once her eyes are opened, she instantly sees her way to Righteousness and Saviourdom! [Good thing she\u2019s insanely wealthy.])About three-quarters of the way through, I was really fed-up with the whole thing. Then the \u2018twist\u2019 happened ((view spoiler)[the \u2018friendly\u2019 local turns out to be a terrorist spy/freedom fighter (hide spoiler)]), and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. But the chance to explore some moral ambiguity was passed up completely. I did however, appreciate that (view spoiler)[ in a romance novel, for ONCE, the girl is the one who proposes and has a strong opinion of what she and her fianc\xe9 should do in the future.  (hide spoiler)] But even that wasn\u2019t quite enough to redeem this book from its clunky and ham-handed politics.\n', u'\n           \n           This is fantasy that is almost historical fiction. No magic to speak of, but it\'s not our own world - rather, a very Earth-like place with different countries and cultures. There are strong parallels to England\'s invasion and colonization of so-called "primitive" countries, with events that may even remind young readers more of the U.S.\'s invasion of Iraq than England\'s conquering of India and other countries. The main focus is a young woman, engaged to be married, whose irrepresible energy, joy, and curiousity about her new land leads her to embrace the culture and its people as whole-heartedly as she can. However, she finds at the end that no matter how much she herself may love this fascinating country, it does not necessarily love her back - because it hates the people who have conquered it and must throw them off at all costs. There is romance and fashion - and a good hard lesson at the end. A fine YA read.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Utterly predictable from the beginning, where a general's daughter is on board a ship to a newly annexed land to join her father and fianc\xe9. She is, of course, willful and yet easily persuaded to see the perspective of the conquered people.I was never convinced by the culture, nor did I find the main character particularly endearing.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'14650200', u'Consecrated to Thee Medium', u'100', u'\n4308494\nPeter B.

But his hard-edged Big Apple voice is absolutely pitch-perfect for the story he is telling, a story involving a host of memorable and very human characters, not to mention a couple of super-human characters: an Incredible Hulk-like toddler and one doozy of a MAN MAGNET, and, yes, indeed, that\u2019s spelled with all capital letters. Meet the lady at the center of the novel\u2019s vortex, Ms. Nicola Six \u2013 modern day Helen of Troy, X-rated femme fatale and manifestation of goddess Kali all rolled up into one \u2013 everything you always wanted and everything you never wanted, your most cherished dream and your most dreaded nightmare, complete with Eastern European accent, mysterious Middle Eastern origins, Ms. World face and figure, shiny dark hair and even shinier dark eyes. Oh, my goodness, what a gal. London Fields is a loose, baggy monster if you are looking for a tight-knit murder mystery; but if you enjoy your novels with many characters finely portrayed in gritty, grimy detail along with generous portions of philosophical musing thrown in along the way, then you will enjoy taking your time with its 470 pages. Now, on one level, the men and women are stereotypes representing a particular social and cultural class, but on another level Amis fills out his characters with such vivid, visceral descriptions, their eccentricities, their passions, their intense emotions and desires, in a way, I almost had the feeling I was reading an epic with the streets of London standing in for the walls of Troy \u2013 modern city life as the ultimate human blood sport. One major character \u2013 Keith Talent, low-class grunge par excellence, a 29-year old addicted to liquor, pornography and sex, has made a life-long career out of cheating and steeling. Any time Keith opens his mouth we hear an open sewer of words \u2013 thick, coarse, vulgar and garbled. If there was ever an example of Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cThe limits of your language are the limits of your world.\u201d, Keith is our man. From what I\u2019ve said, you might think Keith would be totally despicable, a character incapable of our empathy, yet, through the magic of Amis\u2019 fiction, we feel Keith\u2019s pain. By way of example, here is a scene after Nicola, posing as a social worker, barged uninvited into his cramped, dirty, pint-sized home and accused Keith\u2019s wife and Keith of being too poor and too ignorant to properly care for their baby girl. Shortly thereafter, Keith is at Nicola\u2019s apartment and he looks at her and in his look he says: \u201cHome was his secret. Nobody had ever been there before. Oh, there had been ingress: rentmen and census people, the police, and cheating electricians and would-be plumbers and so on as well as real social workers and probations officers \u2013 but nobody he knew. Not ever. Only the dog, and the woman, and the child: the insiders. They, too, were secrets. Home was his terrible secret. Home was his dirty little secret. And now the secret was out.\u201dWords are exchanged. Keith tells Nicola repeatedly she \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u2019ve fucking done it\u201d. Nicola replies \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to know, did you, that you lived like a pig.\u201d. Keith says, \u201cThat\u2019s so . . . That\u2019s so out of order.\u201d We understand the humanness of Keith\u2019s plight \u2013 no matter how crappy and filthy his living conditions, to have his private space violated and be called a pig by such a woman. Second major character \u2013 Guy Clinch, a wealthy, refined, well-educated gentleman with the heart of a love poet reminds me of the 1950-60s British actor Terry-Thomas. Here is Guy in Nicola\u2019s apartment, letting her know how rude men can be about women and sex: \u201cGuy got to his feet and came forward. In no uncertain terms, and with his mind half-remembering some analogous recital, some previous exercise in illusion-shattering (when? how long ago? what about?), he told her what Keith and his kind were really like, how they thought of women as chunks of meat, their dreams of violence and defilement.\u201d Guy explaining the sexual dynamics of men and women to Nicola is like a university student explaining Machiavelli to Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III. Talk about black humor. Among the many other characters, one of my personal favorites is Marmaduke, Guy Clinch\u2019s son who needs an army of nannies to keep him from tearing the house apart and wreaking havoc on adults, especially his mother and most especially his father. When his wife Hope was pregnant, Guy was worried about protecting his son from the world; after colossal Marmaduke\u2019s birth, he\u2019s worried about protecting the world from his son. Here is a taste of what our first-person narrator Samson has to say about the child: \u201cTurn your back for ten seconds and he\u2019s in the fire or out the window or over in the corner, fucking a light socket (he\u2019s the right height for that, with a little bend of the knees). His chaos is strongly sexual, no question. If you enter his nursery you\u2019ll usually find him with both hands down the front of his diaper, or behind the reinforced bars of his playpen leering over a swimsuit ad in one of the magazines that some nanny has thrown in to him. He goes at that bottle like a top-dollar Vegas call-girl, like a grand-an-hour sex diva.\u201d Lastly, a word about the novel\u2019s structure: Samson Young is in the process of writing a novel about the very novel we hold in our hands, offering ongoing critique and color commentary on the art of his telling and the act of our reading. Metafiction, anyone? Nothing like heaping another layer (or two or three) on top of an already many-layered work of literary fiction. \n', u'\n           \n           What a fun fucking book. I blew off everything today (and, well, most of the week) just to read this book, because it was that fucking fun. God, I loved this book. I just read it nonstop, and when the recurring irritation that is my life did tear me away, I kept thinking about what I\'d read, and just ached to go back to read it some more.... I went at this book hard, folks, and now that I\'m finished, I feel like I barely can walk across the room. Maybe this qualifies as Too Much Information, but I think reading London Fields might have given me a urinary tract infection.Okay, so I\'ve never read anything by Martin Amis, probably for the same reasons most of us haven\'t: yeah, remember that guy you knew who liked Martin Amis so much? Yeah. Ughhhh.... yeah, he was disgusting, really repulsive, I know. That arrogant prick. I know, I know.... Well, Martin Amis is that guy, you definitely can tell by his author photo. Last night I was out with friends and trying to convince them to give this book a shot. They both did sound interested, despite misgivings ("I always associate him with this guy I knew in high school, ugh...") until the book came out and got passed around, and unfortunately opened to the author photo. "Sick," Meg said, shuddering, and shoved the book back into my hands. "Sorry," April murmured, shaking her head. "Sorry, but no. Ugh. Look at that guy."That guy: Martin Amis. Martin Amis: that guy.So yeah, and it turns out London Fields is also that guy. You know the guy I mean, that close friend of yours -- every time you meet for dinner he shows up forty-five minutes late, he invariably, embarrassingly, and with appalling success hits on the waitress, and after dinner at drinks he smokes all your cigarettes and keeps interrupting you, and somehow runs out of cash so you have to buy the drinks, even though he makes like six times more money than you ever will. When you hang out London Fields regales you with stories about his job in advertising, about the child idiot label whores he\'s currently dating; he\'s constantly demonstrating his immense cleverness, and often uses words you have sneak off to look up on your iphone OED. Many of his screamingly hilarious anecdotes are about going to nightclubs or whorehouses with his old friends from Princeton. There are always some difficult moments on these evenings with London Fields: the cringe-inducing narcissism, that inevitable rape joke. London Fields is not a guy you\'d ever bring around most of your other friends, especially the hot female ones, or the highly moral ones who\'d stop talking to you for consorting with someone so clearly distasteful and, they\'d be sure, purely evil to boot.But you love this guy. You really do. Honestly you consider him one of your greatest friends. London Fields isn\'t someone you\'d call for comfort during a 4am crisis, and you wouldn\'t talk about politics with him, or probably even about books, even though you both read. You and London Fields talk about Love, and about Sex and Death. You talk about The World. You talk just to Talk. You love London Fields even though he\'s an asshole -- you love London Fields, maybe, because he\'s an asshole, because secretly, deep down, you\'re an asshole too. LF\'s sort of a bad friend, even, you know, sort of a bad guy. He\'s That Guy, but you love him. Because he\'s hilarious. He\'s made a Manhattan spray out your nose before -- it hurt -- the things that he says are so hysterical. Plus, even if he\'s always getting up and running out to the bathroom and therefore missing vast and crucial sections of the movie that\'s Reality, on certain vital points LF is absolutely dead on. And, let\'s be honest here, he\'s got amazing style. He\'s got style like crazy, and sometimes that\'s all you care about. And maybe most nights you get dinner with respectable people, with other social workers and teachers, who are honest and kind. But that shit can get boring, and boring\'s what you can\'t stand. There are better books out there than your friend London Fields. There are libraries full of them. But there are not many books that are this much fucking fun.London Fields is a self-conscious fin de mill\xe9naire novel that takes place in London as the world seems to be ending. The story is a sort of inverted murder mystery following the intersection of four central characters: Nicola Six, sexed-out trainwreck femme fatale rushed direct via SST from Central Casting; psychopathic pre-chav-era dart hooligan and anti-villain Keith Talent; moneyed nothingburger father and husband Guy Clinch; and Samson Young, an ailing, unsuccessful writer from New York who\'s done an apartment swap and who narrates the action as everything unfolds. The plot, such as it is, is mostly stupid, and really sort of beside the point. Who cares? Reading this book made me realize something, which is that the world is really ending; it\'s ending all the time, all around us, just like in the book! I do appreciate fiction that helps me figure out something useful like that, but really what I appreciate is being entertained. Despite some obvious flaws, this book is FUN. To me it was a page turner, and would be perfect reading for a transatlantic flight! This is the first book I\'ve read by Martin Amis, and I\'ve heard that his stuff varies a lot, but based on this one I think of him as a sort of Sidney Sheldon figure for people who are pretty pretentious. If that sounds good to you, I would say give it a go!Well, I might say that. But maybe I shouldn\'t. I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone who\'s easily offended. And by "easily offended" I mean offended by sex, sexism, classism, violence, rape, child abuse, predictable and often lame plotting, stereotypes, sociopathy, gross humor, or pretty much anything else. There are jokes in here about dog- and babyfucking, for example, so if you don\'t find that sort of thing hilarious, you might stay away. If you\'re not easily offended, though, and not too snobby, then you might love this book. It really was a lot more fun than I\'d expected it to be -- I\'d thought MA was better known for being "smart" than "fun," but his priorities seemed the opposite. And like all good fun, or funniness, it was very dark. It was dark and did get at things that are Serious Concerns, but it did it right, not all ponderous, truly did stay a blast. Every few pages there was a line that would actually make me emit a little scream of laughter, or else get dangerously depressed about not being able to come up with shit like that with my own feeble brain. A book isn\'t good if it doesn\'t make you insanely jealous of its author at least part of the time. There was stuff in here that made me want to hunt down Martin Amis and pry out portions of his brain with a screwdriver, for future grafting to my own somewhat sludgier, less linguistically and comically flexible organ.I\'d hang out with Martin again, if I ever find myself in a certain mood. He\'s not the kind of guy you want to spend every waking moment with, but there are certain times when you\'re really glad you know someone like him. Please don\'t get me wrong: there was some dumb shit in this book, but I\'m not going to criticize it, because the thing was that I just didn\'t care. The dumb shit didn\'t get in the way of my enjoying the book immensely. So Martin can come on over, interrupt me, show off his vocabulary, smoke all my cigarettes, and tell me about the new 20-year-old girlfriend and her $600 shoes; I\'d be happy to have him, as long as no one else is around.Recommended! (With caveats, like all responsible recommendations.)\n         ', u'\n           \n           Ha!I did it. I finished London Fields, after a week or so on a roller coaster, up and down, loving it, hating it, being annoyed, bored, laughing out loud, bored again. In the end, I actually caught myself crying as well, which was the last thing I expected, having worked up a genuine distaste for the book somewhere in the middle.I don\'t think I have ever read a book that I could easily give either one star or five stars, and feel perfectly justified to do so. I rarely change my mind so completely several times over the course of 500 pages either.How to sum it up? No clue. The author (as opposed to the narrator) knows how stories are made, and he can write them. He can create interesting, funny, sad, dangerous characters, and make the reader laugh out loud at the humour of his descriptions. Yes! He can do that. But he can also spin a web of betrayal and deception, telling the story from different angles, over and over again, driving the same reader that just laughed out loud to the brink of insanity.So, it is a story of a murder. Actually, since we know all the protagonists from the start, and know that the murder will occur in the last act, I would say rather than a crime novel, it is a wordy, rambling Greek tragedy. As everyone knows the plot, the outcome and the story, the charm (if there is such a thing!) lies in the psychological development of the characters. The murderee takes on the role of guiding us through the different acts, and in a way we witness her suicide, as she thoroughly plans her murder herself. Maybe she is the MURDERER as well, even though she is not the one actually holding the lethal weapon. But she destroyed Keith, and Guy, and Sam, and the novel, so she certainly is the femme fatale of the story, in the most literal sense of the word.There is only one hero in the book. I did not realise what a hero he was until his heart was broken by a weak man and he lost his herculean power and completely changed his character. That\'s when I started crying. The hero\'s name is Marmaduke. The childhood of Hercules!How am I going to rate this book? As Martin Amis managed to quote my favourite poem from The Poems Of Wilfred Owen on the very last pages: "I am the enemy you killed, my friend", I can\'t give the book one star even though I was mad at it for at least 300 pages. I can\'t give it five stars either, because that might make other people think I\'d recommend it. I don\'t. If you read it, it has to be on your own responsibility. I only read it because I randomly decided this summer to read three books by authors I didn\'t know before which featured London in the title. I did not like the first one I chose, The Lambs of London, and the jury in my head is still (passing) out on this one, so I am more than worried about the third in the chosen trio: London Orbital, which I will start when I have recovered strength from this one.To be fair, this one is incredibly fascinating as a concept, and I AM happy that I read it (and that it is over now)! I won\'t forget it! And I know more about the tactics of darts (there are none), than I did before.Here\'s the sinus curve of my reading itinerary:Starting to read: Perfect first paragraph for a tired evening, after discarding any books looking remotely like intellectual struggle:"This is a true story but I can\'t believe it\'s really happening. It\'s a murder story, too. I can\'t believe my luck. And a love story (I think), of all strange things, so late in the century, so late in the goddamned day.This is the story of a murder. It hasn\'t happened yet. (It had better.)"" page 6  "I don\'t claim to make fast progress on this, but here we are, quote on page 6:"He never had what it took to be a murderer, not on his own. He needed his murderee."This is a VERY weird perspective, even for trained Humanities teachers who teach different angles, and personal biases for a living??" page 34 "If the author chooses a confusing narrator, the characters can\'t really be blamed for their strange appearance, right? This feels like a wordy novel version of Sei personaggi in cerca d\'autore - but the narrator, or author, admits to having been conned by the bad character." 1 comment page 37 "I feel like I might be reading this book backwards, as I make so slow progress. I also vaguely suspect that I will start hating it soon, so I better write down some things I like before that:"As for the two pigs, they were yahoos even by the standards of the yard."Pigs as yahoos? What would the humans be then, in the universe of Gulliver\'s Travels? Above or below on the class ladder?" page 41 "The poor foil Guy must be totally lost in London, if it really is a pub pretending to be a city, for he has something I did not know existed, but that I think I have always known to exist anyway (Lord, this book makes your brain spin!): he has PUB ANTICHARISMA. Is there a cure?Does it mean London is allergic to him? Would it help if we gave London antihistamins?" page 86  "I have discovered a major flaw in London Fields:To enjoy the confusing story, you need a glass of dry Riesling. However, if you have a glass of Riesling, you can\'t follow the confusing story anymore. (Why does this make me want to reread Catch 22 all of a sudden?)You might for example miss the fact that two consecutive chapters describe exactly the same situation, but from different characters\' point of view!" page 127 "I take back the comment that the narrator does not know what he is doing. In fact, he knows so well what he is doing that he is mingling with the murderer, murderee and foil BEFORE the murder has happened, in order to collect the materials for his murder story a priori. In fact, he is a bit impatient and wants to start chapter 7 before it has actually happened. I wonder if that makes London Fields a futuristic novel?" page 178 "I am starting to worry about this novel. The narrator needs one of the main characters to guide the story, and discusses cutting out other characters with her. He is also seriously ill and has pressure from his publisher, who can\'t see how he is going to fill the middle of the novel. I agree: we all know the end, and the beginning was strong, but to go on for several hundred pages with silly cheats and darts? Really?" page 180 "And I don\'t like it when the book catches me being condescending. Literally two pages after I complain about the darts storyline going on forever, I read this:"But don\'t you be snooty about the darts. They matter in all this."Well, we\'ll see about that. Maybe it is not a good idea to update progress on London Fields. I might be trapped in a fake plot. Should just read the whole thing and do the Caesar thumb sign." page 237 "I am thoroughly annoyed with the work distribution in this novel by now: the narrator has dumped the whole plot development on the murderee, who has to work incredibly hard to get the other characters to move towards some kind of climax, and the murder itself is threatened by the fact, revealed very late in the day, that KEITH IS NOT EVEN GOOD AT DARTS!" page 308 "The murderee rocks! She has decided to force the lazy narrator, murderer and foil to move forwards with the plot. Very much appreciated by the suffering reader! The fact that almost all scenes are retold several times from different perspectives to show EVERY POSSIBLE angle of the "not-yet-existing" murder story made me want to scream for about 100 pages. Now I am back where I started: I suspect a shadow of genius..." page 400 "The world according to Keith, or maybe The Dart Gospel According To Keith:"The trouble with darts they are no good when you are pist." (sic!)That is a catch-22 if there ever was one! Things undoubtedly speed up a bit, thanks to the heroine who can\'t wait to get murdered. As a means to achieve her goal, she is now involved with everyone, playing all the available parts at the same time: virgin, whore..."

After work. Late. Half-sober. Some sample conversational starters/topics:What was Marlon Brando\u2019s best performance? Does it involve butter?Why does Pon Farr take seven years? Does this mean the Vulcan\u2019s don\u2019t have porn?Who was the greatest left handed pitcher of the seventies?What do you mean there\u2019s another version of Blade Runner?How drunk is \u201cTom Waits drunk\u201d?Why can\u2019t we meet women? This one, was of course, rhetorical.It was a group of guys, usually about six or seven of us \u2013 oddly, there were two brothers, about a year apart: one had a Brooklyn accent, one had a British accent. I don\u2019t remember the whole Dickensian saga about why this was so, it was just, well, odd.We were talking about Kingsley Amis and Lucky Jim, probably because it was funny and involved drinking and bad behavior, when the Brit brother mentioned that Kingsley had a son, Martin, who wrote a book called, Dead Babies and that it was terrific.It was pretty good. And so was his book, Money. Fast forward about a million years later and now, this one.Amis is an uber-writer, who crams more wit and ideas into a single paragraph than a lot of writers can churn out in a lifetime. Although some critics have tried to tag this as sci-fi/end of the world, they\u2019d be missing the point. The \u201ccrisis\u201d is mere background - window dressing - to one of the more assiduously crafted character studies I\u2019ve read in quite a while \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter that the world is going to hell in a hand basket \u2013 the baser elements of human nature still shine on. Which is a good thing.The story revolves around Nicola Six, she\u2019s the planet Venus, around which the lesser moons of Guy Clinch and Keith Talent erratically revolve. She has the ability of predestination and can predict her own murder. She manipulates these two stooges into making it happen.Clinch is the very model of the upper class stuffed shirt twit, who\u2019s systematically bilked and painfully led around by his \u201clittle Guy\u201d. Talent is a small time, dim witted hood who\u2019s adrift in anything beyond darts (\u201cDarts, innit?\u201d) and his seamy world.Throw in an unreliable narrator and \u201cauthor\u201d of the story, Samson Young, and you have the makings of corrosively entertaining read.Favorite character: The baby from Hell \u2013 Marmaduke. For starters, French kissing the nanny and trying to bite her tongue\u2026This book isn\u2019t a \u201ccasual\u201d read, but it will be well worth the time a reader will invest in it.\n', u'\nMany thanks to \u21e8 this review\u21e6 for providing the inspiration!\nGosh!

In Section (I) we argue for the attractiveness of using computer modeling techniques in the study and design of complex social systems. In particular, we advocate the use of the modeling, simulation, and analysis techniques of System Dynamics. In Section (II) we, then, present a System Dynamics model we developed for software project management. The model\'s three major subsystems: the human resource management subsystem, the planning and control subsystem, and the software production subsystem, are discussed in some detail. Finally, in Section (III), the dynamic behavior of the model is analyzed using a series of simulation runs. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The prospect was devastating, and also scary\u2014how would she navigate the world without the person who gave her life? She thought about all the motherly advice she would miss\u2014advice that could help her through the challenges to come, including the ordeal of losing a parent. <br /><br />The next day, Hallie asked her mother, writer Suzy Hopkins, to record step-by-step instructions for her to follow in the event of her mom\u2019s death.

I appreciate the extremely difficult task it took in organizing this complex book - the time frames, the accounts from the witnesses, the victims and the German SS troops who watched and who also shot the Americans. Nothing is left to wonder about. That years and years of research went into this book is obvious. Danny is masterful in all details. Yes, you have to follow the blood trail - yes it is complex, and it\'s not a light read. But this is one you\'ll remember. The horror as the soldiers realize they are going to be killed - you can hear the sliding of the bolts, the clink of metal, the cold snow, the smell of blood. Danny, you are a truly great writer and this task was not pleasant. It needs to be told and told like no one has done before. My admiration, Regards, Pat\n         ', u"\n           \n           I really wanted to be engaged in this book; I read about the Malmedy Massacre briefly in another book and that was why I picked this one up. The author is the leading expert on the event, though, and I think he got a little too caught up in showing how much he knew than relaying the events to the readers. While every survivor and victim is important because it was a real event, it's not possible for me to keep track of all of the people and places that Parker talks about. All the names and places just blurred together and I read through the three chapters of the actual massacre and still wasn't sure what had happened because it alternated between the wounded, the Germans, the Americans elsewhere, and other members of the group not present. It was just too confusing and not very well written. \n         ", u"\n           \n           This is a very gripping account of a tragic incident that occured during the opening phase of the Battle of the Bulge toward the end of WWII. The intentional massacre of captured American soldiers by elemenys of a Waffen SS armored unit and the subsequent attempts at revisiionist attempts to cover it up are illusrative of moderen warfare at its worst. Much of the story is told in the words of German participants and American survivors. This results in some redundancy but is also illustrative of how eyewitnesses see the same event but all report it somewhat differently. This is an extremely well researched and documented book- there are over 125 pages of appendices and notes. Don't fail to read appendix IV as it pretty much ies everything together. A compelling read.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Parker, the go-to authority on the Battle of the Bulge, outdoes himself with fine narrative and research in this book on the Malmedy Massacre. The first book on the subject to truly delve into both the U.S. and the German sides of this tragic story and balance the two with the hard facts. Perhaps a bit more information covering the rather controversial trials of the accused (Peiper, Fleps, etc.) at Dachau would have rounded out the book at the end. Excellent maps and illustrations. Highly recommend.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I bought this book because I was interested in learning more about Malmedy. but the writing was terrible. in an effort to be thorough the storytelling became disjointed with frequent backtracking and the retelling of previous episodes. as such, keeping the chronology straight became the focus instead of learning about the massacre.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'27929797', u'Drawings Accompanying Specifications, Volume 121', u'52', u'\n5969532\nUnited States Bureau of Reclamation\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5969532.United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2015', u'9', u'19', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

I threw it at the robbers, with an intention to frighten them away, and set the poor bee at liberty; but, by an unlucky turn of my arm, it flew upwards, and continued rising till it reached the moon. How should I recover it? How fetch it down again? I recollected that Turkey beans grow very quick, and run up to an astonishing height. I planted one immediately; it grew, and actually fastened itself to one of the moon s horns.\u201dI guess Baron had one bee too many in his bonnet\u2026The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen is capable to arrest attention equally of children and grownups and may be greatly enjoyed by both.\u201cWe looked round, and now found the reason why the postillion had not been able to sound his horn; his tunes were frozen up in the horn, and came out now by thawing, plain enough, and much to the credit of the driver; so that the honest fellow entertained us for some time with a variety of tunes, without putting his mouth to the horn\u2026\u201dThe tale of the frozen music is one of my favourite\u2026Books are the sort of frozen music as well. We open them and the music of words thaws.\n         ', u'\nA True StoryI went out this morning for a hike and also to search for new books in the forest. At this time of year the book-beeches don\u2019t bear fruits anymore, of course, so I took my spade with me and hoped for some leftover hardcovers beneath the snow. I know of a few spots other book hunters usually avoid for whatever reason. So I went there and and started digging but all I found were two half rotten YA novels and an unidentifiable volume that looked fine at first, but when I opened it I found it to be full of holes eaten by bookworms. Just before I decided to give up I spied a small book sticking out of the snow. It seemed perfectly intact, and the title promised some pleasurable reading time: The Travels and Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen. It was a travellog of sorts and a memoir of one Baron Munchhausen written near the end of the eighteenth century. Eagerly I started reading while walking home. My way back ran along a pass road. The path was slippery and I wasn\u2019t paying attention, so I slipped and fell over the cliff. I realized it would be the end of me if I wouldn\u2019t come up with some idea of how to save myself. Looking down I saw the ground approaching fast, but I didn\u2019t want to rush things, so I sat back and thought awhile. I read that Munchhausen was riding on a cannonball once, but there were no cannons anywhere near, and even if there were there was nobody to fire them. I also read that Munchhausen once used a couple of ducks to fly home, but there were no ducks around either, or any kind of bird for that matter. Using the book as some kind of parachute was out of the question, because it wasn\u2019t big enough. So I read the rest of the book rather quickly to see if there were some other advice in it, but, alas, there wasn\u2019t. Finally I had an idea! I figured I would only die if I hit the ground. So if I could get rid of the ground and avert hitting it I would survive. And that\u2019s what I did. Just before I crashed I put the book back into my pocket and took the spade out. The ground was rather soft, so I was able to shovel the earth away and behind me, just like a mole does. Unfortunately my speed was still increasing so I had to work very fast. After many hours of digging I reached the center of the earth. That\u2019s when I finally started to slow down and I stopped completely shortly before I broke through to the other side. And here I was, far away from home, on the opposite side of the planet, and the day was almost over. My folks back home must worry about me by now. I looked around and saw the date line not far away, and I was to the West of it. What a lucky coincidence! I stepped over the date line into yesterday. This gave me plenty of time to dig my way back home where I arrived just in time for supper. \nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n         ', u'\n           \n           \u201cWhen we had reached within two days\u2019 journey of the ship, we observed three men hanging to a tall tree by their heel; upon inquiring the case of their punishment, I found they had all been travelers & upon their return home had deceived their friends by describing places they never saw, and reciting things that never happened: this gave me no concern, as I have ever confirmed myself to facts\u201d - Baron Munchausen\u2018The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen\u2019 is an enjoyable & satirical account of the fictitious exploits and travels of the fictionalized \u2018Baron Munchausen\u2019. These tall-tales, which are narrated by the Baron to his listeners, are fabulous to read and are full of political, social and personal satire.This is a book that was originally published in 1785 and has gone through a string of additions in the course of time by various publishers. Originally written by \u2018Rudolph Erich Rapse\u2019 \u2013 who himself has donned many hats in his personal life by being a scholar, miner, expert on minerals and gems, authority on antiques and a swindler \u2013 the mendacious tales of \u2018Baron Munchausen\u2019 and his impossible adventures are delightful & incredible creations of a very rich imaginative mind. The original tales written by Rapse were rather small in length but were later appended by various publishers during the late 1700s with sequels, supplements and additional chapters. This book contains the original chapters written by Rapse \u2013 and the add-ons and supplements written until 1789 \u2013 and an additional "Volume Two of the Baron\'s Travels.", which was a sequel published in 1792. The first part of the book is pretty easy to read as they are small individual tales arranged as chapters which are only two three pages in length. (view spoiler)[This initial volume contains such notoriously incredible exploits like Baron\u2019s adventures with a Lithuanian horse; his wartime adventures & subsequent visit to the Moon; Baron getting swallowed by a fish; his exploits during the siege of Gibraltar; Baron getting shot out of a canon and Baron jumping into Mt. Etna and meeting with Vulcan & Venus. The second part of the book narrates Baron\u2019s exploits & travels in to interior of Africa - in a mighty caravan, which is pulled, by none other than the mythical Sphinx & nine powerful bulls-; North America and India. (hide spoiler)]The book is written with the sole purpose of entertaining and entertaining it does! For me the innocent purposelessness of these lies makes them quite enjoyable; they are brilliant at the same time being with out any intent of malice.The adventures of Baron Munchausen are tall-tales at its zenith and is a very light read which, can be enjoyed by all those who like to have a good laugh.Note: I thank my friend Sidharth Vardhan for his really hilarious review of this book, which made me immediately pick up this book for reading. \n', u"\n           \n           After few slower books, it was nice to read something quick and just lose myself in the story. This book was perfect for that. I \nreally\n enjoyed reading it. I think the reason why I enjoyed reading it this much, was because of the humor. The humor in this book was right up my alley. Great short book, that I'm sure I'll re-read again more than once.\n         ", u'\nIt is, you see, difficult to stay connected with old friends that is why I once created this website where you could find and meet your old friends. I was in a good mood that day and since it hardly took me an hour to create it, so I gave it to this young boy \u2013 try as I may, I can\u2019t recall his name Mark something, he was pissed off after his GF broke with him. I can\u2019t recall his last name zuck \u2026 berger \u2026 bug\u2026Anyway I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if this same website was not used by some of my enemies to exaggerate my little powers and thus ridicule them. If there is one thing I can\u2019t tolerate \u2013 it is deviation, even slightest deviation from truth. One of them said that I once lifted an anaconda to save a child with a single hand to save a child in its grip and threw the beast away. It is such a stupid lie \u2013 How can people believe that? I could barely lift the animal with both my hands.Anyway it spoiled my mood and I happened to be presiding this interplanetary conference that day. When representatives of Pluto (they are yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dogs with black ears having particular love for rats) were five minutes late.... I confess my anger was unjust but what happened is what happened \u2013 and now, Pluto is no longer a planet.I could have cooled down but for a while the queen of England; she knows me from when I sold a lock of my hair to end the last economic depression; was pestering me over which president should her people chose next. People just can\u2019t understand that I have more important things to do. In frustration, I told her to just go for the last one again. I think she did. I have no time to follow the news in all my universe-saving endeavors. Just last week, my good friend Doctor Who (I once mended his toy machine TARDIS) visited me to ask my help in saving a planet in a galaxy, name of which can\u2019t be pronounced in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.All this work makes one moody. Even now I was planning to give a speech which would have ended all the evil in the world and make Earth a heaven but I have changed my plan since my pizza was no good (I\u2019m tired of you lesser mortals) and my date Jennifer Aniston is late.. She says she is twenty two but I highly doubt that. Women often hide their age around me. Anyway she was a big letdown after Marilyn Monroe and \u2026 Venus. And, don\u2019t even ask me about Helen. Ah! those were the days - specially when Greeks fought with Troy believing she ran away with Paris!---------------------\nPART 2\nI have discovered that a lot of people are taking what I have said as mere tall tales when, in fact, if ever I was guilty of lying then it was because I couldn\'t do away with my habit of modesty. For example, this once, back in very old days - it was just a week before I handed those commandments to Moses; I participated in this village wide game we were playing where you have to throw rocks, and person whose rocks hits the ground furthest would win. May be I just happened to pick up too big a rock but I lost the game. Now tell me, would I be a tall-tale teller when I say I was a distant last in among hundreds of players? My throw was, in fact, so terrible that rock never landed; it just stayed out there in sky \u2013 people call it moon. Funny name! isn\u2019t it, for a rock?Once I was on this \u2018moon\u2019 \u2013 I often go there in search of solitude; when what I see is this vehicle lands near me and a man comes out of it in a clownish white silver dress and starts saying some stupid things like \'big step\', \'small step\' -I really didn\'t get it. He was still rambling when he saw me; his face turned red. "Aa! You kids!" I said watching him stop, "And your little games! Cute!". When they realized the truth, they started begging me to let them have the credit for being the first to be on moon. I let them, I was too modest to claim any credit for myself. I heard they had to destroy all those photographs taken there to keep the secret.Anyway, I\'m not much for publicity. This once upon a time, I was sleeping at an airport when this aeroplane suddenly got some technical problem in landing. People began panicking which is all you mortals seem good for, and there was a lot of noise -it waked me up. I was obviously angry at being woken up in this manner - and just to shut them up, I stretched my arm to take hold of aeroplane and put it on ground. My arm hurt for weeks after that. Someone not believing the evidence of his eyes shouted "but it is humanly impossible." "Yes,\u201d I said not knowing what he meant, \u201cWhat is your point?"Yet, you won\'t see any account of this event in any of newspapers because I took special pains to make sure it won\'t get publihed. Although, censoring this news from newspapers was way too easier than censoring this photo of mine with that guy who happened to be at airport. Personally I\u2019m not much about being photographed but he; I think I can recall his name ... Yes, Robert Downey Jr. he kept on insisting.Yet another reason, I won\'t come out is because I\'m just too lazy. Last time, your humble narrator felt like actually doing something was a long way back. It was so dark out in those days that I had to began by calling for light (\'Let there be light\') and so it went as I worked for six days straight (I signed my creations with pseudonyms like\'God\' in those days) ...but then I thought that I really do not want image of a hard-working person - specially someone who won\'t even take Saturdays off, it doesn\'t suit me. Also, my work from last day was terrible one - man (although I perfected it later in second attempt) And so I spread a rumor that it all started with a Big Bang. Yet, another cover up was the evidence of evolution (fake dinosaur homes) that I planted all over the planet. It all went well. Giant lizards! Really, people will believe anything.I think it is just me people find it difficult to believe \u2013 maybe I just give the wrong kind of waves. If someone else was to say those things \u2013 you would believe him or her. I won\u2019t know why. For example, I once wrote this document about the workings of the creation I just talked about; I remember I was with an Egyption queen that time. Another name I can\u2019t recall, I have such a bad memory for names \u2013 anyway, I used to call her Leo. She was some woman, she cheated on three different guys with me (her brother, Ceasor and Anthony). Every time I went to her, she would be with a different man. I gifted her this lovely cross breed pet, she used to call it Sphinix \u2026 but I\u2019m diverting, my point being, it was while coming back to present that I thought that this document would be useless because people never believe whatever I say and so I threw it away. Some one seems to have found it, Isaac was it? Now while no one believes anything I say, everybody believed him when he said that he got all this from falling of an apple!__________Part 3I see people still seems to be thinking that I just tell tall-tales. Now if you visited my town, you would have known the fame I have for my honesty, they swear on it \u2013if they want to praise someone\u2019s honesty they will say he is as honest as our great lord Manchurian (since that the title they use for me) or if they want to assert truthiness of something, they will say \u2018believe it as if our great lord M. has said it.\u2019 The Roman people were even better- they named a whole month after me \u2013 of course it later deteriorated from Munch to March but hey, it is the gesture that counts. And of course Johnny Depp, whom I was just talking with, could have told you - but he is won\'t be seen with me. He says he feels eclipsed by my presence.I responded if it is any consolation DiCaprio feels the same.Of course sometimes one have to lie, I mean if kids comes to me and say how much they like Arybhatta for inventing Zero or Vinci for his paintings or Mozart for music he created \u2013 I can\u2019t help nodding while trying hard to suppress my smile. We can\u2019t take away children\u2019s heroes, can we? Still I don\u2019t like people who will take credit for work done by others. Edison was at least honest enough to never actively claim undue honor. He always talked about discovering 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work, he never said anything about discovering that single way that did work, did he? Ever wondered why?Ya. You are right.Other people though aren\u2019t as honest. Even now I have just received a phone call, they were from committee deciding who gets from Nobel prize for Economics. Of course, like every year, I told them to find someone else - and tell the committees for Physics, Chemistry and Physiology to do the same. It has become a habit with them, every year they are pestering me with phone calls. I tell you it gets on one\u2019s nerves. I have often changed my number, but they always get it from CERN, where I happened to be the president. The peace prize ones are the worst of lot, given my peaceful attitude there is no stopping them, that is why I didn\u2019t tell the economics guys to try.And what about Literature? you ask. The thing is I no longer write anything. I wrote this long collection of stage-plays this once. I lost them all during my visit to a theatre on Queen Elizabeth\u2019s invitation. If I\'m right (and I\'m hardly ever not) it was my horse-man, William something, who stole it.Ever since I have lost the taste of it. And to be honest I judge people who will do nothing but read all day. I mean how lame is that! Get a life!You know what else I don\u2019t like? People pretending to be cleverer than they are. Just last week I was visited by this Baker street kid who thinks he is a detective and his Doctor friend; quickly the former launched into that case he need my help for \u201cthere is this murder\u201d he was saying \u201cthere are no clues, no motives, nothing peculiar\u2026.\u201d\u201cSherry! Sherry! Sherry!\u201d I interrupted his monologue, shaking my head once for every \u2018Sherry\u2019, \u201cThe younger sister is the murderer. You can dig in the garden in the right hand side of her neighbor\u2019s backyard, for the knife with her fingerprints on it.\u201dHe and his friend were shocked for some reason. After taking his time to swallow his pride, he asked \u201cHow do you know? It is not even in newspapers.\u201d These kids I tell you! \u201cOh! It is obvious, Listen Sherry and try to understand and you, Hamish\u201d I said looking at his friend, \u201cYou just listen, Okay! \u2026 In the beginning there was word.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Sherry said, somehow, not finding the explanation sufficient.\u201c\u2026 and all the rest follows.\u201d Can the chain of reasoning be more obvious? Well it wasn\u2019t for those two, so I had to explain them in detail. Of course, I won\u2019t insult your cleverness by going into explanations.I have always found these geniuses to be more irritating than others. This another kid, supposed to be a genius, kept irritating me about his observations and about how he was sure that energy was somehow a curtain or something over matter or something until I lost my temperament and had to interrupt him telling \u201cNot so clever Einstein, e equals m c square.\u201d I tell you it is difficult to be a genius in a world of mediocre people \u2013 fortunately though most of you will never know this feeling. There was actually this one time I lost my temperament and decided to destroy the whole planet. Start the whole thing all over again, you know! Of course in all my kindness I wanted to give humanity a chance to mend their ways. And so what I do is bring a couple of really big asteroids, put them in ocean, put some people on it and tell them that world is going to end on Decemeber 21,2012 (since that was the day I decided). And so they build their calendars and everything accordingly.\u201d Next, I go and tell Columbus to look for India in the West.Of course people didn\u2019t change their ways and so I was all bent on destroying the World. I had everyting set in order but had to abandon the plan due to health reasons. Damn You, common cold!After that I was too lazy to go through it all over again. Anyway, it is more fun this way - Didn\'t I put Donald duck (or was it Trump) as contestant for US elections just for laughs of it! Still,I wonder what it feels like to be stupid \u2013 sometimes I do have this really absurd dream, in which I\u2019m just a stupid guy who reads some books, thinks himself clever for that, writes foolish reviews with lame jokes on a websire and is glad to get a few, what-can-only-be-called, pity likes.

Sixteen Grade Four and Five classes in four Hong Kong primary schools were studied to determine how teachers and students experience and exercise power in classrooms in the context of Hong Kong, and how that power is expressed in such varied combinations. Observations, individual interviews and document analysis were the main data collection methods employed. <br />The study identifies three major patterns in teacher-student power relations in 73 observed classroom lessons: Pattern I (Teacher Domination); Pattern II (Equal Opportunity for Power Sharing); and Pattern III (Student Self-Empowerment). Pattern I classrooms demonstrated student disempowerment, while Pattern II and III classrooms were characterised by teacher-initiated and student-initiated student empowerment, respectively. The study finds that, in each power pattern, teachers and students play a variety of classroom roles (teachers as rule- and textbook-enforcer, learning-facilitator and learning-assistant; students as rule- and learning-follower, learning-partner and master of learning) and adopt different power strategies (manipulation, giving-power and standing-back among teachers; compliance, cooperation, and self-governance among students). <br />The study also identifies six players/forces (facilitating factors) shaping teacher-student power distribution: (a) the cultural value of respect for authority and for teachers; (b) the Curriculum Reform initiative and the promotion of student-centric teaching modes; (c) school policies and cultures; (d) subject nature and curriculum contents; (e) teachers; and (f) students. Based on its findings, the study suggests viewing teacher-student power relations in the context of Hong Kong as a reflection of multileveled intertwined interactions. This interpretation implies that teacher-student classroom interactions are affected by various factors in a wider context, rather than mutual effects between teacher and students alone; each factor involved in a multileveled context (classrooms, schools, education system, and Hong Kong society) shapes teacher-student power relations. The coexistence of the three identified power patterns and the related empowering and disempowering situations is the result of the individual and collective effects of the six facilitating factors. <br />This empirical study supplements the understanding of teacher-student power relations in the context of Hong Kong by proposing a theoretical framework that relates to the local socio-cultural, educational and school contexts. The study suggests the need for further explorations of teacher-student power relations at other school levels in Hong Kong and in other cities in mainland China or elsewhere. Additional potential directions for future research include an exploration of the development of student empowerment inside and outside of the classroom in a purposive case school and an exploration of teacher-student power relations in specific subjects. <br />DOI: <a target="_blank" href="http://10.5353/th_b4730893" rel="nofollow">10.5353/th_b4730893</a> <br />Subjects: <br />Teacher-student relationships - China - Hong Kong', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'24529161', u'A Reason to Forget (Camdyn #3)', u'332', u'\n8546581\nChristina Coryell\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415916504p5/8546581.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415916504p2/8546581.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8546581.Christina_Coryell\n4.42\n2191\n456\n', u'2015', u'1', u'11', u'Coryell Publishing', u'\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about life \u2013 just when you think it\u2019s nearing absolute perfection, you find yourself flat on your back on a stranger\u2019s filthy green shag carpet, simply trying to remember how to breathe.\u201d \u2013 Camdyn <br /><br />A charming new home, welcoming new hearts, and the promise of forever with Cole Parker \u2013 Camdyn is tempted to say that things are just about perfect.

It is so good. \n         ", u"\n           \n           I sincerely wish I could leave more than 5 stars for this book. When Christina Coryell sent me her first book in The Camdyn Series, A Reason To Run, I knew immediately here was an author I wanted to watch. The book was so much better than I would have thought a first effort by a new author would be. It was amazing. So was the second book in the series.Now we have book 3 in the series. (There will be 4, by the way.) Camdyn and Cole have been married two weeks when the book opens. Things just take off from there and do not let up at all. Written in the first person, Camdyn tells her tale in a way that draws the reader in from the very first line and does not let go till you read the last word. Camdyn's latest book (she is an author) is published and she must make the talk show circuit. As she's readying herself for these appearances, she finds an envelope tucked into the corner of the book her husband Cole gave her as a wedding gift. A book Cole has found that belonged to Camdyn's dad and she longed for very much. The note is urging someone named Darlene to come home. And so the mystery begins....Heartbreak and heart soars follow after this discovery. And, as usual, Camdyn is terribly unpredictable and so many things happen to her that would never happen to anyone else. Camdyn is so incredibly witty that I found myself laughing out loud. I also found myself crying, too. In Taco Bell one time. Try to explain that to the customers around me. There is a wonderful lesson here, too, regarding forgiveness. It's not always easy; in fact, it never is, but with God's help, it is possible. This was an amazing story and I'm so sad to be at the end of it. I wanted it to just go on and on. I love all these wonderful people in this little town in Tennessee. One thing that is super delightful is watching the love grow and soar between Camdyn and Cole. I tried to imagine them as seniors, loving each other the way they do. They were perfect for each other.Christina Coryell is definitely an author to keep your eyes on. For sure. I know I certainly will. I definitely will get every book she writes from now one.*I was provided a copy of this book by the author in exchange for my honest review, which I have given.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Oh my gosh, I don\'t think I can wait until "Spring 2015" to find out what happens next!! This is the third book in the Camdyn series that I have had the pleasure to read and I find my self so fortunate to have "discovered" the talented Christina Coryell. She has a way with words and writes such delightful and thought provoking stories. Camdyn is quite funny and I find myself laughing out loud at some of the things she goes through. This story was also quite touching to me. I lost both of my grandparents to Alzheimer\'s and to read Camdyn and Hannah\'s visit with Isabel sent me back to sitting with my grandparents and going through exactly what they went through. Also, to read Etta\'s story hit home as well. I am a first generation American and my family was all born in Germany. I remember hearing stories of things they experienced when they came to the US. Cole and Camdyn\'s relationship is sweet and loving and delightful. The forgiveness theme was strong in this story and I\'m glad to have witnessed Camdyn and Rita\'s journey. I can\'t say enough good things about these books except to go and pick them up! You won\'t be sorry!!I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for the opportunity Christina!\n         ', u"\n           \n           A Reason to Forget is book 3 of the amazing, funny zany and heart wrenching series by Christina Coryell.Camdyn Taylor Parker is best selling author C. W. Oliver who found herself in Tennessee researching a book.She meets Cole Parker , they have a whirlwind romance and are married at the end of Book 2.There marriage still has the interruptions, now with the arrival of Camdyn's mother and the discovery of a letter in an old book that leads her on another journey across the country.I love Camdyn with her hilarious accident prone nature and her love for Cole and his for her.The underlying theme throughout the book is forgiveness and how God forgives the unforgivable. This why we need to rely on him and follow his whisper in your ear.Christina gives you a story that holds you from the first word until the end.I do like her bringing the past to the forefront and applying it to today.I am eagerly awaiting her next novel and Camdyn's journey.A copy of this book was given in exchange for an honest review\n"], 0]!!!![u'23327316', u"Jimmy Wheelz and the Minilights: When Things Push You Down, Don't Quit!

My life was irrevocably changed that night. The night I was taken. I saved a man's life, but at what cost to myself? Could I convince him to save me in return? Pediatrician Claudia Ellers is jerked out of her own safe, secluded world and brought into one of danger and uncertainty on the night that she is kidnapped by Bradley Smith. He forces her to save the life of his best friend, Sean Reynolds, under threat of death. But when her task is complete, Sean decrees that she can't be allowed to leave; she knows too much. Claudia is resentful of her captors, desperate to escape. But the more time she spends trapped with Sean, the harder she finds it to cling to her hatred for him. He is an enigma of a man, one who is shockingly arrogant, sweetly contrite, and frighteningly aggressive by turns. And the sexual tension between them is scorching. The longer she remains in his grip, the more confused she becomes about what she must do.

After doing all she can for him Sean\'s best friend Bradley decides Claudia needs to go and is ready to off her permanently when Sean steps in to stop him. Now let me just say, that for two guys raised in the Irish mob, these two really SUCKED at planning on the fly. Their whole plan for Claudia was basically keeping her in that one room for the rest of her life (apparently.) I\'m serious, that was basically how the first 25% of this book went. Claudia saying "you can\'t keep me here forever!" and Sean saying "I can\'t let you go" Add in googly eyes at each other, kisses, snuggles, and Claudia snooping and finding Seans "red drawer of pain" and you have a summary of the first quarter of this book.Thankfully she is finally let out of the room and taken outside, where she promptly escapes. The pace picks up a bit and Claudia is approached by the cops to rat out Sean and Bradley. She is reluctant at first but psycho Bradley seals the deal when he shows up at her house to threaten her. Twists and turns ensue. Betrayals are revealed. Sean Fifty Shades Claudia\'s ass at every opportunity. Yadda...Yadda...Yadda.So as you can probably tell this one was a bit of a mixed bag for me. The pacing was ALL over the place. In some parts, the story moved along at a nice pace and I was hooked and enjoying where this was going. At other times it was SOOO slow I think Miss Daisy was driving herself. The first 25% was excruciating, and I almost gave up. The middle 50% was up and down, and the last 25% was really good.Overall the main story gets a 3-star rating from yours truly. There are also two bonus stories at the end. The first is basically Sean and Claudia and a lot of the peeps we met in the main story. They are all at a BDSM club and some sexytimes occur and we get a permanent ending to the Bradley situation. The second is a nice little Christmas story with Claudia and Sean and their new baby. Claudia has been dealing with some stuff and Sean Fifty Shades her ass until she tells him what is bothering her. I really enjoyed these two extra little stories, so they brought my overall rating up a .5.\n', u'\n\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 3.5 "ME LIKEY" Stars\n\n', u'\n           \n           Dr. Claudia Ellers is kidnapped to save Sean Reynolds life. Bradley, Sean\u2019s best friend kidnaps Claudia and then forces her to help Sean, who has a bullet in his shoulder. Sean and Bradley work for the Irish mob. Sean is the first man Claudia is attracted to in a long time. Claudia has a hard time getting close to people, but with Sean she seems to have an instant connection. Sean and Claudia are thrown together during an intense time and they grow close to one another. Claudia\u2019s world is turned upside down and it slowly changes her.I\u2019m not sure I like Sean. He can be cruel, mean and rough and than other times he is tender and kind. He is a dominate man and wants Claudia to submit to him. One thing I can say, when Sean and Claudia are together, it is scorching hot.This is a story about two people from different worlds who meet in an unexpected way. Sean and Claudia slowly evolve and are forced to make some hard decisions. It is a dark, edgy series that at times made me squirm. Sean and his friends are volatile and there is a lot of violence in this book. Some of the characters didn\u2019t have any redeeming qualities. At times, I needed to take a break from the characters because they upset me and the story was so intense. This is an interesting, well written, dark story about the underbelly of life and the people who exist in it. Can good overcome evil and can people change for the better? .Reviewed by Karen for Cocktails and Books\n         ', u"\n           \n           While I enjoyed the series, I found the plot to be a bit shallow and a 50 Shades wanna be. How many times can one get accosted leaving the office and trying to get into one's home? I also thought the portrayal of organized crime and FBI procedure very weak, as though no research went into it, rather the author's limited perception of both. On the positive side, a good read for purely escapism and fun without taxing the brain.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Not my usual cup of tea... but wow, I'm glad I drank it.The writing style is simple (I prefer descriptive narrative) but beneath the words are strong emotions, an exciting storyline and strong characters, both good and bad. Not a fan of erotica either, especially not BDSM-themed ones, and especially not after reading the first 50 Shades book, but the Impossible trilogy was so much more. I feel that the sex aspect in most erotica I have come across so far do nothing to move the storyline along and is pretty much redundant (in fact many sex scenes in books bore me) but this trilogy finds a good balance between both sex and story. Thank god for a summary that I simply couldn't resist. In fact as I'm writing this review, I feel like rereading the whole series again.The first book was definitely my favourite and the one I thought was the best out of all three. I was annoyed by Claudia and her martyr behavior in the second, and in the third, I found the ending to be rushed and the storyline very thin. Even the finale climax was boring and without much action, too quickly over, and less than ordinary. But wow, the first book was all I needed to keep me reading the rest of the books. I was hooked right from the beginning and I never wanted to stop.I love the premise of the first book and the circumstances under which Claudia and Sean met. The tension (both sexual and non-sexual) was so thick and well-built up, as with how their relationship developed. Both went through struggles and conflicts of their own and with each other -- all of which was effectively and convincingly portrayed. I really loved their contrasting personalities, careers, everything. I'm also glad that it took Claudia time to come to terms with her own feelings and understanding, and that her survival instinct to flee was present throughout. She didn't just 'get' stockholm syndrome (an issue that was well-explored) and gave in to her feelings, which made the story realistic.The strongest thing about this trilogy, its selling point and what the author did the best job in writing about aren't the sex scenes, the thin and at times weak storyline, but Sean and Claudia's relationship -- good pacing, effective development and more. Other characters like Bradley and Clayton were memorable and well-written too.As a whole, I found myself empathising with Claudia and being able to relate to her, even though I didn't always agree with her (which is a good thing on the author's part as the character isn't one-dimensional). She wasn't weak nor did she let any men control her, even after everything she went through. At times, she even reminded me of myself.If you are looking a book that is simply about passionate and scorching hot sex, this trilogy probably won't do it for you. But you are looking for a good read, then you are in for a rollercoaster ride with the Impossible trilogy -- one of entertainment, excitement, pain, heartbreak and so much more.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'25298570', u'Beitr\xe4ge Zur Herpetologie des Rh\xf4netales und seiner Umgebung von Martigny bis Bouveret', u' ', u'\n13780120\nG.

The success of the method being of far more importance than the success of the book, it is particularly gratifying to the author that a second edition is urgently called for. The book cannot be used as a quiz compend; it does not take the place of the larger treatises; it is only of value in connection with the cadaver, and as in the present form it seems to fulfill the purposes for which it was published, but few changes have been made in the text. <br />If the whole period of dissection is more than twenty-eight days, the additional time can well be applied by taking two days, for each of the assignments up to and including the fourteenth, thus making forty-two days in all for the dissecting of a part with as many hours per day as is deemed advisable. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Then I saw it was set in NC, where I currently live and that it seemed to have a paranormal slant to it. That did it. I decided I was in and I\u2019m glad I did. Well-written with a great plot and lots of detail, the past and present parallels made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I do have a couple of minor complaints though. The bad guy doesn\u2019t explain anything. No monologue or reason why he did what he did, past or present. I\u2019m left in the dark as to why R\xed\xe1n was targeted in the past and how the bad guy found Ryan and Cait in the present. Too many unanswered questions. Also, I couldn\u2019t get any real grasp of Cait\u2019s personality and, to be honest, I didn\u2019t like her. At all. I know that doesn\u2019t make sense, but hear me out. I cannot stand women who withhold information and then act all hurt when people get pissed at them. And then, she blamed Ryan for rushing her to bed before she could tell him. Sorry, you twat. You have a mouth and you were with him for hours. Hours! Don\u2019t get on your high horse and teary because he\u2019s now pissed at you. Gah! Ok, I didn\u2019t like her. End of rant. She\u2019s not around all that much in this story anyway, so all-in-all this is a great paranormal mystery that builds the suspense quite nicely.\n', u'\n           \n           In January 1839 in Ireland, R\xed\xe1n Kelly was a constable in love with Caitlyn (aka Cait). As the Night of the Big Wind approaches, women were being murdered. R\xed\xe1n had to go to Dublin and when he got back after the Night of the Big Wind, he discovered that Cait had disappeared. He was heartbroken as he searched for her.In August 2011 in North Carolina, Ryan Kelly was a cop. Originally from Ireland, he moved to the U.S. with his sister, Claire ... I could still "hear" their accent in their dialog. For years, he had been having vivid dreams of a woman that seem so real. When Ryan met Cathleen (aka Cait), he realized it\'s the woman he has been dreaming about and instantly fell in love with her. R\xed\xe1n was Ryan\'s ancestor and as he read R\xed\xe1n\'s diary, Ryan realized that history was repeating itself ... women were getting murdered just before a big storm hit ( 2011\'s Hurricane Irene). How can that be?This is the first book I read by this author and I liked it. I liked the writing style and the stories kept me interested ... I was curious as to how/if they would come together. The story was written in third person and focused on wherever the action was. After all the jumping back and forth in time, I had hoped for a different ending.I liked the characters. R\xed\xe1n and Ryan are both cops who are tracking serial killers but we get to see their emotional side since they have found "the one". I liked Claire, Ryan\'s sister, and her young daughters ... they love and keep an eye out for Ryan. Though I liked Caitlyn, I didn\'t connect with Cathleen.I look forward to reading more books by this author. Blog review post: http://www.teenaintoronto.com/2013/10...\n', u"\n           \n           I enjoyed this unusual suspense story. Unusual in the way the story is set up. I love the parallels and the concept of I am living my life out the same until my past heartache is resolved and the mystery surrounding it is closed. Ryan is a detective from Ireland working a set of murders that are causing him to have more nightmares than usual. His anger is thinly veiled and rising with each restless night and murder. His dreams are of a past that he can't quite figure out but he is sure he knows. Meanwhile the murders seem personal and a reporter who gets his hackles up comes to town.Cathleen the reporter. The one in his dreams only she isn't in his dreams. She frustrates him but also intrigues him. From the moment they spend a minute together there is a bond forged. A need and desire but he is guarded due to a misunderstanding. Ryan fights hard against his desires and this frustrates him more. So does the fact that his dreams are becoming more intense and frequent since she came into his life.Ryan is already dealing with a ruined marriage and why which still makes him angry, murders that are nagging him, dreams that are prophetic and remind him of Cathleen and trying to just hold on to his sanity. Something that is on a thin line. The past anger comes crashing around him and he does make mistakes. Mistakes that show he is human but they do cost him. Cost him alot and also in his mind respect. With nothing left to lose he pulls down the walls when it comes to Cathleen and lets her in. While this is happening he begins to read his favorite uncle's journal and it freaks him out. He sees parallels to his life and begins to ponder things. His murder cases begin to come together and he starts to put pieces in place. I love his nieces and how open that they are. They encourage him to be with Cathleen and help his sister see that he has not lost all his marbles and that his instincts are right. While all this is taking place, danger lurks for both Cathleen and Ryan and Ryan senses this but cannot completely change Fate. Fate is a fickle beast and here it must play out.A book of intrigue and romance. One where they fight what they want and need in order to come together in a more harmonious way. A suspense that has you question Ryan's sanity at times but intrigues you as well as you see greater forces play a role in all that is happening. Who says the misdeeds and unjustices from the past can't haunt the present? Who says that love cannot be sent through generations and bring people together at the moment when it is needed to help get calm and clarity in one's world? This book is a testament to all those questions as more as you surely will plunge into this intriguing book with questions and come out with a smile. A wonderful read from start to finish with characters that will have you wonder what is up with them as they try to become whole and piece together and solve the murders at the same time. \n         ", u"\n           \n           Ireland January 6, 1839, the Epiphany and Night of the Big Wind that swept the Atlantic across Ireland, a day many believed to be the beginning of the end of the world. It certainly seemed that way to those in Ireland. It was the day Constable Rian Kelly lost the love of his life, Caitlyn O\u2019Conor, but did he lose her to the storm or to the serial killer that had murdered women in their village who favored her? August 2011 Detective Ryan O\u2019Clery is investigating a string of homicides in Lumberton, N.C. that eerily mirror those committed over one hundred years ago. Is history about to repeat itself?The premise of THE TEMPEST MURDERS is exciting, the suspense thrilling, and the past mirroring and providing clues to the present furnishes much food for thought. These are the aspects I truly enjoyed about THE TEMPEST MURDERS. However there were a couple things that bothered me.Ryan is more a stereotype than a real hero. Surly with everyone but his sister and nieces, he runs hot and cold with Cathleen O\u2019Reilly, behaving boorishly then apologetically. Cathleen is often superimposed with Caitlyn. We know why Ryan feels so strongly toward Cathleen but there\u2019s no sense of that being reciprocated other than she continues to return. She\u2019s like a paperdoll, no real substance. Cathleen\u2019s marital status is in question but Ryan continues. In consideration of his recent situation and moral character that didn\u2019t fly well. The other thing that ground my hamburger with these two is they never actually talked! Not once did they ever ask sincere questions, hang any questions at all really, or make an honest effort to get to know each other. These two barely skimmed the surface. Their strong visceral attraction wasn\u2019t enough to make me believe in Ryan and Cathleen as a couple. Being admittedly ignorant about police procedures and such I could be out in left field. Cathleen is a television reporter from Atlanta. Captain Johnston tells Ryan to work with Cathleen on the murders because they correlate to murders in Atlanta. Wouldn\u2019t his best bet be to work with the lead detectives on the Atlanta case? Police don\u2019t always release all their information to the press. Discovering what she knows, yes, but working with her?THE TEMPEST MURDERS is the first in a series. The second book, The White Devil of Dublin, per the blurb delves into the origins behind THE TEMPEST MURDERS mystery. That makes it worth a shot with hopes the characters have developed some depth and grown beyond where we left them. Reviewed for Miss Ivy's Book Nook\n         ", u"\n           \n           In Lumberton, North Carolina, Detective Ryan O'Clery is working a series of homicides when he comes into possession of a journal kept by his great-uncle, five generations earlier. In his writings, Constable Rian Kelly details an eerily similar set of murders that he is investigating in Dublin, Ireland, during 1839. The number of victims steadily increases - until the night of January 6, 1839, when the 'Night of the Big Wind' swept the Atlantic Ocean across Ireland - completely devastating the country.As Hurricane Irene barrels towards the North Carolina coastline, Ryan O'Clery discovers that even the killer's description that Rian Kelly mentions, matches exactly Ryan's prime suspect for the homicides in North Carolina. And as he falls in love with television reporter Cathleen Reilly, he wonders if she is, in fact, the reincarnation of Caitlyn O'Conor - Rian Kelly's fiancee, and the suspected final victim of the killer - lost as the storm raged across Ireland.Ryan is in a desperate race against time. For, if reincarnation is possible, then Ryan suspects that he may just be the reincarnation of Rian Kelly. Now, he must rescue Cathleen before the killer finds her. Or risk losing her forever, as history appears destined to repeat itself.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. As I've said before, I do like stories that have paranormal overtones to them, and mysteries of any kind woven throughout storylines certainly intrigue me. I also like reading stories that are in any way connected to Ireland. I was originally born in Belfast, although until I was about four years old, my family and I lived in Dublin. Anyway, I give The Tempest Murders by P. M. Terrell a definite A+! and look forward to reading more from this author in the future.I just wanted to mention something that happened that surprised me: I had just finished reading this book, and was telling my mom about it. I was explaining how part of the story took place during the 'Night of the Big Wind', when I noticed that my mom was looking at me sort of curiously. I stopped speaking, and she picked up a magazine off a stack of Irish magazines that had just arrived in the mail the day before. The magazine was an issue commemorating 175 years since the 'Night of the Big Wind'!\n         "], 0]!!!![u'31733307', u'The Normal Seminar: Educational Number', u'34', u'\n14468423\nEastern Washington State College\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14468423.Eastern_Washington_State_College\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'5', u'24', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

A few weeks ago a goodreads friend had mentioned reading The Book of Emma Reyes: A Memoir and it piqued by interest as a memoir by a South American artist from the 20th century. A product of what early reviewers call a Dickensian upbringing, Reyes overcame a horrendous childhood to later become a top artist of her native Columbia. Although she did not become literate until later in life, a chance friendship with Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garc\xeda M\xe1rquez encouraged Reyes to write the letters that later became this book. With a new English translation by Daniel Alarc\xf3n, The Book of Emma Reyes: A Memoir has gained a wider audience and notified more people of the life of this prized artist.Emma Reyes could list among her friends Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Jean-Paul Sartre. This is after she called Paris her home and joined an ex-pat community well established in Europe at the time. As a small child, however, her life was nothing short of horrendous. Along with her older sister Helena, the two girls were brought into the world by their mother Maria who immediately suffered from a severe case of post partum depression. Unfortunately for the girls and their two half brothers, a diagnosis for this mental health disorder did not exist in 1910s Columbia, and often times the children were left to fend for themselves for entire days, many times locked in a room with no food. At the time, Helena was six and a half and Emma no more than five. They had a full time nanny at times, but Maria moved the family all over Columbia in an attempt to better her own position in life, and she usually clashed with the nanny and fired her, leaving the children on their own yet again. Even if Maria comes across as unloving and self-centered, one can not help but think if she lived in a different time and place that she could have received help for her depression and gone on to love her children. Yet, Emma writes longingly of her mother because at age five, her mother is her entire world.The coping became to much for Maria and one by one she abandoned her children. Helena and Emma were brought up in a strict orphanage run by nuns even though they were a product of an illegitimate relationship. Eventually, they were accepted by the church, but the descriptions Emma gives in her letters are nothing short of heart rending. Based on a girl's looks or abilities, she received choice tasks to complete. This was not an orphanage where a girl would receive an education. In order to finance the welfare of the one hundred fifty girls, the nuns put them to work at all tasks from cleaning the bathroom and kitchen to embroidery and being personal assistants to the nuns themselves. Each girl had nuns they forged better relationships and vice versa. Emma had the misfortune of being the younger sister to Helena, called the most beautiful girl in the orphanage, while being cross-eyed herself. As a result, it took her many years before she could establish a group of friends while also being stuck performing the worst of tasks in the orphanage. It is of little wonder that by the time she reached adolescence that she thought about the wider world outside of the orphanage and her means of escaping from it.Alarcon did a fine job with the translation, but it is evident that the writing is simplistic in form. Reyes' letters were not geared toward a juvenile audience, but because she did not learn to read or write until her late teenaged years, Reyes had a limited vocabulary. As a result, this memoir can be viewed as a coming of age story, which I mentioned recently that I have found myself enjoying less and less each year. I am glad that Reyes was ambitious enough to leave the orphanage and fend for herself, resulting in her becoming a gifted artist and traveling the world. It appeared even from an early age that the nuns spotted her talent but because of her life situation she lacked a means to cultivate it. While I felt for this horrendous childhood, I read quickly to find out when the misery would end, but, unfortunately it never did in the course of this book.While I enjoy reading books by women of color from around the globe, I was not enamored with The Book of Emma Reyes: A Memoir. It was an easy reading book to get through at a busy time of the year for me, but not a book I would necessarily choose had I not been alerted to both the topic and cover on goodreads. Perhaps because Reyes was known as an artist, I would enjoy her artwork more than this memoir. Nevertheless this memoir points to the lack of mental health awareness in the early 20th century and is a worthy read.3.5 stars\n         ",

The R language provides everything you need to do statistical work, but its structure can be difficult to master. This collection of concise, task-oriented recipes makes you productive with R immediately, with solutions ranging from basic tasks to input and output, general statistics, graphics, and linear regression.Each recipe addresses a specific problem, with a discussion that explains the solution and offers insight into how it works. If you re a beginner, "R Cookbook" will help get you started. If you re an experienced data programmer, it will jog your memory and expand your horizons. You ll get the job done faster and learn more about R in the process.Create vectors, handle variables, and perform other basic functionsInput and output dataTackle data structures such as matrices, lists, factors, and data framesWork with probability, probability distributions, and random variablesCalculate statistics and confidence intervals, and perform statistical testsCreate a variety of graphic displaysBuild statistical models with linear regressions and analysis of variance (ANOVA)Explore advanced statistical techniques, such as finding clusters in your dataWonderfully readable, "R Cookbook" serves not only as a solutions manual of sorts, but as a truly enjoyable way to explore the R language one practical example at a time. Jeffrey Ryan, software consultant and R package author"', u'848', u'4.01', u'310', [(u'to-read', 405), (u'currently-reading', 68)], [u"\n           \n           A part of the cookbook series is expected to provide a multitude of examples of useful tasks. The R Cookbook does this, but also more. This provides more, teaching about R beyond what reference books and most tutorials.One weakness of R compared to other data analysis environments and programming languages is it's lack of coherence that comes from a central design. Instead it seems like a set of constructs, each designed differently. As an example, the multiple packages for graphic. Every user of R soon picks up idioms from tutorials or trial and error. Book authors use their favorites. But the effect is that it is hard to know what you do not know. And one does not realize the realm of the possible.The R Cookbook does this. In having multiple related recipes together what it provides are a number of closely related tasks, done in different ways. And using different idioms. And I have taken advantage of it, learning more ways of working with various data structures, the apply family of functions and other data transforms. This makes the R Cookbook even more valuable then the typical member of the O'Reilly Cookbook series. Well recommended.I receive a free electronic of this book as part of the O'Reilly Blogger program.More information on the book can be found at O'Reilly Press\n", u"\n           \n           If you love learning by doing this is your book!R is the best statistical software package on the market (although it's free, so technically there is no market for it). Its functions outstrip those of SPSS and STATA by far. So naturally everyone doing statistical work should be familiar with R. The R Cookbook is designed for clear cut problem solving. You want something being done by R? This book will have a description how to do it and a detailed section of what you are actually doing. This book will help you master the steep learning curve of R and within a short time you'll never want to go back to SPSS or STATA. A lot of the statistical techniques are explained in the detailed section, so even if you are relatively new to statistics you'll learn the most basic aspects by reading this book (I would strongly recommend a full stat intro)If you are doing more sophisticated analysis you'd still have to check the internet for additional resources. This book covers the basics, but lacks some of the statistical tests (e.g. White's test). Once you know how to handle R, implementing additional statistical procedures shouldn't be a problem.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I agree that this is not a book for the beginners, but nevertheless it started with the very basics. I was impressed about it though it is from a Cookbook series.The approach in the book is: if this is your problem, here\'s the solution, followed by a discussion which provides great amount of detail about the concept or function. This format allows the book to be used as a reference guide as well as it will assist us to jump to a point directly. The book illustrates plenty of functions of R in this fashion. There are parts of the book that educate us about Statistics itself, but prior knowledge of some Statistics is a must if you want to make the best of this book.The author shows examples from a variety of libraries - MASS, Cars93, zoo, XML to name a few. Enthusiastic readers will explore the data sets in these libraries and become more hands-on. The chapter on Useful Tricks exposed many of the "helper" functions. These add to the convenience while working with R.The code samples for the book seemed incomplete when I downloaded them. But this worked for my benefit in the sense that I spent more time actually writing the code or creating the data myself - helped me get a little more comfortable around it\'s syntax.

Or if he were on that schooner, heading out into the sunset, into the world! That was life, that was living, doing something and being something in the world. And, instead, here he was, pent up in a close room, racking his brains about people dead and gone thousands of years before he was born.Having no knowledge of who Jack London was before reading this, I can now safely say I know who he is. He was an American author born in 1876 and, judging from The Cruise of the Dazzler, really, really, really liked boats. Jack London loved them so much that this book, which was his first one to be published, is a boat-lovers-bonanza. I appreciate the enthusiasm in this book, and one has to wonder whether the starry-eyed protagonist who daydreams about sailing the seven seas while trying to study is actually Jack London himself.Whatever the case, I found quite a bit to like here. I liked \u2018Frisco Kid and Joe\u2019s interactions, and enjoyed seeing Joe become a sailor, though I\u2019m not the biggest fan of where this story eventually goes, and the message it\u2019s trying to convey. You see, Joe ends up with a bunch of bay-pirates, who steal and do bad things. As much as Joe loves to sail, he\u2019s a moral teenager, and doesn\u2019t like thievery or dishonesty. To cut a long story short, once he leaves the bay-pirates, his dream of sailing is seemingly abandoned as he returns to his father and explains everything to him. The novel ends on an odd note, really. I wanted to see Joe actually achieve his dream, maybe he and \u2018Frisco Kid run away and get their own boat, something like that. Instead, the message of the book seems to be - get good grades, get a nice safe job, and beware of bad people. It\u2019s pretty lame, really, though I understand what Jack London was going for. He was going for the whole \u2018I\u2019ve-returned-and-learnt-a-valuable-lesson\u2019 thing. But I would have found it more interesting if this story ended up on the opposite end of the spectrum, y\u2019know, the \u2018don\u2019t-stop-pushing-toward-your-dream\u2019 thing. Well, regardless, I had a pretty good time reading it, anyway. Props to Jack London for writing nice, concise chapters. Chapters in this book are not long, they\u2019re short and sweet, which is just the way I like them. Also, rarely in this book did the writing feel monotonous or boring. There were a handful of times this happened though, but, as the chapters were such a nice length, there was never a time the book dragged horribly (cough, Dickens, cough). In an odd turn of events for me, I actually wished the overall novel length was longer, can you believe it!Me of all people, who goes on and on about having books be nice and quick, get in get out and all the rest of it, me of all people is saying this! Yes, in fact, I am. You see, as I mentioned above, I wanted to see Joe actually achieve his dream, not give up in the end and learn a valuable lesson because he hooked up with pirates. \u2018Frisco Kid, while he definitely had a character-arc of sorts, could\u2019ve had more page-time, too. This is a complement, kids, because I\u2019m saying I wanted to see more of these characters. French Pete can go **** himself, though, he was an ass. But, yeah, I think delving more into these characters and possibly extending the story a bit would\u2019ve been great. Another pretty big thing, and this is potentially my biggest problem with the book. Were it not for this problem, The Cruise of the Dazzler would possibly receive four stars from me. There is so much \u2018boat-slang\u2019 and weird word usage that continued to fly right over my head the whole way through the book. I\u2019ll give you an example of a sentence with heavy \u2018boat-slang\u2019 with question marks around phrases I don\u2019t understand:Twice he heard the waves buffeted back from some flying (forefoot?), and once he saw a sail to (leeward?) on the opposite (tack?), which (luffed?) sharply and (came about?) at sight of him. Unless you\u2019re heavily into boats, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re supposed to know what half those phrases mean. This didn\u2019t make me want to stop reading the book, because I still wanted to find out what would happen with Joe, but it was jarring, especially when I\u2019m really getting into the story, really trying to sink myself in, and then all this jargon comes up out of nowhere which makes no sense to me. \u201cWell, ugh,\u201d you say, staring at your monitor in disgust, \u201cif you weren\u2019t so stupid, Isaac, you\u2019d know what that stuff meant.\u201dAnd to this I say, why, you\u2019re utterly, totally correct! Thank you for reminding me of my stupidity! I\u2019m going to watch reality television now. Duh-duh-dum-dee-duh. \n', u'\n           \n           One of the things I enjoy most about reading works by Jack London are the place descriptions. "The Cruise of the Dazzler" is an action packed story that takes place in the San Francisco Bay area. Having grown up and worked my way through school on the Oakland waterfront, I truly enjoyed re-reading this story. London\'s technical descriptions of how his main character Joe, learned to sail from the Dazzler\'s young crewman, "Frisco - Kid," provided an authenticity that is sure to keep the attention of any reader.\n         ', u"\n           \n           this is a great story, and a real jem. i've read it several times and i am buying it for my 12yo twin boys to read. \n         ", u'\n           \n           The Cruise of the Dazzler is about a young boy who has little focus and is failing as a student. His father\'s disappointment in him leads him to run away and become a crew member on The "Dazzler". During his time as a sailor the boy spends most of it fancying the thought of being on a vessel but he doesn\'t spend much time working before he returns back home in an effort to prove to his father that he can make a life for himself as a sailor.While there aren\'t any notable flaws with the way this book is written I simply just didn\'t enjoy it very much. I found it to be rather dull, which came as quite a surprise to me considering London\'s novel tend to have quite the opposite affect. I thought The Cruise of the Dazzler was too focused on discipline and had too much of Huckleberry Finn type feel to it. I would have preferred a story more focused on the boy\'s struggle as a sailor, a story with more brutality and hardship but instead it seemed like the boy sort of just lazy wandered onto a ship and then lazy wandered back home. In the end, I would recommend this book simply because it is well-written but I find the story is far from fascinating.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'26396693', u'Expanding Into the Light: Discovering the Realms of Near Death Experiences Through Spiritual Practices', u'176', u'\n440733\nRon Jones\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/440733.Ron_Jones\n3.51\n801\n133\n', u'2015', u'8', u'13', u'Fastpencil Inc', u'This book would be of great value to anyone seeking spiritual awakening and growth.

So while I have enjoyed these first 2 books I really can\'t give anything like a overall review until the trilogy is done. The 4 Stars are really more for the continuing story than actually for this book itself. I can hardly wait for the conclusion.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This was a really great read, following on from the first in the triligy Throne of Ice, in a coherent and enticing manner. It quickly draws the reader in, and I very much enjoyed the plot and character development. This book pulls in characters from other folk tales in a clever way, without distracting from the main plot development. I am really looking forward to reading the final book, I need to know what happens, to see how the story moves on and ends, for me a sign of a good book is that I don't want it to finish, and am ready for the next instalment. Suitable for young and older alike.\n", u"\n           \n           This is the second book I've read by this author and once again I have come away impressed at this writer's ability to take some familiar characters and storylines and create new sagas from them. The language in these stories is wonderfully descriptive and I love the imagination as familiar characters take on slightly different roles and find themselves on different adventures. If you like fairytales you might absolutely love these books. If you aren't a traditional fairytale lover, I think you might love this writer's storytelling regardless.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'31242550', u'New Territory Revealed', u' ', u'\n1435724\nLarry Morris\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1435724.Larry_Morris\n4.52\n25\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'2', u'5.00', u'2', [], [], 0]!!!![u'23528736', u'Rose', u'240', u'\n9843247\nJes\xfas Li\xf1an\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9843247.Jes_s_Li_an\n2.00\n1\n1\n', u'2014', u'7', u'', u'mundopalabras', u'Un viaje, un encuentro.

These were the women who left for war looking for adventure and romance, but were soon confronted with challenges for which their civilian lives could never have prepared them. Their strength and dignity were remarkable. Using diaries and letters Peter Rees takes us into the hospital camps and the wards and the tent surgeries on the edge of some of the most horrific battlefronts of human history. But he also allows the friendships and love of these courageous and compassionate women to enrich their experiences, and ours. Profoundly moving, this is a story of extraordinary courage and humanity shown by a group of woman whose contribution to the Anzac legend has barely been recognized in our history. Peter Rees has changed that understanding forever.', u'1054', u'4.17', u'406', [(u'to-read', 233)], [u'\n           \n           \u2018It makes us feel we are helping just a bit, and the wonderful self-denial and courage of them all the time, all the time!\u2019In July 1917, Sister Alice Ross-King was on duty at the Second Australian Casualty Clearing Station near Armentieres in France when the Germans began bombarding the hospital. Sister Ross-King had been called to see a patient delirious with pneumonia and was following an orderly, Private John Wilson, along the duckboards when a bomb exploded near them.In her diary, Sister Ross-King later recorded that: \u2018The noise was so terrific and the concussion so great that I was thrown to the ground and had no idea where the damage was.\u2019She got up, and raced along the duckboards to check her patients. The tent with the pneumonia patient had collapsed and she shouted for help. Eventually she found her patient on the ground at the back of his stretcher. She leant across the stretcher to try to lift him. She thought she had her arm under his leg, but when she lifted it: \u2018I found to my horror that it was a loose leg with a boot and a puttee on it.\u2019 It was Private Wilson\u2019s leg. The next day, his torso was found in a tree.This incident is one of a number of memorable moments in this book. Peter Rees has drawn from the diaries and letters of some of the nurses from Australia and New Zealand who served in the First World War. \u2018As nurses in Australia and New Zealand saw it, the issue in 1914 was quite simple. They wanted to be there, with their boys, when they went to war.\u2019 By the end of the First World War, 45 Anzac nurses had died on overseas service, and more than 200 had been decorated. Among the 200 were Alice Ross-King, Clare Deacon, Dorothy Cawood and Mary-Jane Derrer who each received the Military Cross for their bravery in July 1917 during the German raid.I was led to this book after watching the ABC TV series \u2018The Anzac Girls\u2019 earlier this year. The series, which focusses on the lives of four of the nurses (including Alice Ross-King) reminds us of the importance of the role played by nurses during this conflict. It reminds us, too, of their courage and strength, their dignity and devotion to their duty. This book provides more background and more detail of the lives and work of these women. Of the personal and professional sacrifices they made in support of Australia\u2019s war efforts. These women were also heroes, frequently discriminated against, unrecognised and unacknowledged.  \u2018For all the returned nurses in this early pot-war period, it was soon clear that they remained invisible from the emerging Anzac legend, which comprised only men. This was a product of the times, when women were still regarded as dependents of men. Authorities in Australia saw the nurses\u2019 role as secondary to that of the soldier.\u2019The diaries of Alice Ross-King, who died in 1968, are in the Australian War Memorial where Mr Rees had access to them in writing this book. She was a remarkable woman, and I hope that her complete diaries are published one day.I recommend this book, to those who\u2019ve watched \u2018The Anzac Girls\u2019 as well as to those who haven\u2019t. This is another aspect of World War One: the very significant role played by some dedicated and courageous women. Their story deserves more attention. Jennifer Cameron-Smith\n         ', u'\n           \n           When we think of war, we generally think of soldiers. In World War I, we imagine them in the trenches, drowning in mud and the immense suffering of those who were exposed to lethal gasses. What I don\'t think about as much is those who eased the suffering of these soldiers. Women who weren\'t even particularly welcome, sometimes at all, at the front, who risked their lives to work in field hospitals, dressing stations and the countless other hospitals that saw to the unthinkable numbers of wounded.This book tells the story of the nurses who left their comfortable homes in Australia and New Zealand and fought in a war. Fought with the same amount of courage as any other soldier. Maybe they weren\'t holding a gun but they were tending to wounded on the same ships that were getting torpedoed and they drowned just like any other soldier. They tended to the wounded in hospitals that got shelled and they were killed like any other soldier. They caught the Spanish flu, got shell shock and they had to don their gas masks when the gasses reached them. They lived in horrendous conditions and had to work under duress just like any other soldier. Of course, they witnessed a horror and carnage that I can\'t even comprehend. Women spent actual YEARS of their lives focused on the care of "their boys." And of course it wasn\'t ALL completely horrible. People flirted and fell in love. Especially at the beginning of the war, there was time for exploring and sightseeing between battles and nearly all nurses saw the world for the first time. I learned a little about Australian politics and a lot about the war. Some sections moved a little slower than others but I thought that more factual history was tied in very nicely with diary entries and the personal experiences of specific nurses. It has certainly given me a much great appreciation for nursing and the role that they played for those in their care.War is horrible. Actually and completely horrible. The numbers of lives lost in The Great War makes me feel physically ill. I think this book is important because it puts a human face on the numbers we can\'t even comprehend.\n         ', u'\nThe Other Anzacs by Peter Rees offers the reader the chance to delve into the lives of those mostly forgotten heroes of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). This is the story of those forgotten heroines; the nurses from Australia and New Zealand who volunteered to follow our soldiers into the Great War and provide nursing support under some of the harshest conditions imaginable.Most served on the Western Front and a number lost their lives looking after wounded Allied soldiers. This is a great book, easy to read, well researched and nicely presented. The book is full of interesting facts and touching first-hand accounts. I found the book a pleasure to read and I learnt for the first time of the sacrifices made by these marvellous nurses, which I think more people should know about.\n', u'\n           \n           I read this book to compliment the ABC Television series the ANZAC Girls, which this book is based on. I found this book a fine accompaniment to the Television series but also a comprehensive history of the forgotten heroines of the ANZAC legend, the hardworking nurses who served in the Great War. This book combines well an array of sources such as diary entries, personal letters, official documents, a collection of photographs and firsthand accounts of the nurses. At times, the accounts are extremely moving, the nurses faced unimaginable horrors while working in harsh conditions such as hastily erected hospital camps, tent surgeries and ill equipped hospital ships. Counteracting these horrors of the battlefield, are tales of mateship and love, these are the parts which I enjoyed reading the most. This is a well researched book that does a good job of opening the reader\u2019s eyes to the sacrifices made by these courageous women. \n', u"\n           \n           This book took me a little while to get in to, as it's a bit dry at the beginning, with all the footnotes and quotes punctuating the story. But once I got used to it I found it very interesting. The strength of these women was amazing. The death and destruction they must have seen during the war seems incomprehensible but the book gives you a good idea of the horrors of war. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'33392514', u'DSST Organizational Behavior Exam Secrets Study Guide: DSST Test Review for the Dantes Subject Standardized Tests', u' ', u'\n4709953\nDSST Exam Secrets Test Prep Team\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4709953.DSST_Exam_Secrets_Test_Prep_Team\n4.75\n4\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'12776986', u'Vita di Niccol\xf2 Machiavelli', u'502', u'\n1404103\nRoberto Ridolfi\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1404103.Roberto_Ridolfi\n3.77\n13\n1\n', u'1954', u'', u'', u'Angelo Belardetti Editore', u'', u'26', u'3.67', u'6', [], [], 0]!!!![u'20045412', u'Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft Excel (7th Edition)', u' ', u'\n194990\nDavid M.

I read all of the books I could get my hands on and as time went by, the more I cherished my Paddington books (still own them). When I heard that Harper Collins UK was releasing a brand-new Paddington book (from a friend on Goodreads), I requested it on Netgalley. I wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t sure if it was going to be the same as the classic Paddington adventures of my youth but was thrilled to hear that this was written by Michael Bond before his passing.Paddington and the Browns are back for seven all-new adventures and they include some delightful mishaps such as pouring rain and the post, gardening, a cooking show and more. The chemistry and whimsy are infused in Paddington\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Finest Hour for a whole new generation of readers. I loved it and read it over and over again. Whether you are a child or a grown-up, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll fall in love with Paddington all over again. The illustrations are beautiful and reminiscent of the classic illustrations. A must own and read!Many thanks to Harper Collins UK and Netgalley for giving me an ARC in the hopes I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d review it.Favorite Character/Quote: Paddington.

Paddington's adventures have always been innocent & amusing & this is no exception. While the author's age may affect his writing a little there is plenty of charm in these stories. Besides, you have to love a bear who thinks he's being helpful by licking a plate clean so that it can be used by someone else. \n         ", u"\n           \n           Five Marmalade Sandwich StarsWell it's official, history truly does repeat itself. I started my reading journey as a child with Paddington books (I still have all the paperbacks to prove it) and I've come full circle, through every genre you can think of, back to Paddington. I enjoyed my Paddington experience as much as ever, it would appear my love of this bear and all his misadventures has never died, he is still as affable, naive and lovable as ever, a truly classic experience. A great read with all the usual suspects (I'd forgotten how mean Mr Curry was). A lovely classic to read to your children and grandchildren, or great for the kids to read on their own when they're at that stage. I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review (I saw it and could not resist, not once did I regret my decision).\n", u"\n           \n           A short, lovely book of stories about Paddington, a clever, well-meaning hellion of a bear.As far as I understand, Paddington is a cultural icon in the UK, something akin to Winnie The Pooh or Peter Pan, an instantly recognizable character that many people grew up with. But where other famous characters got somewhat lost in time as books about them came and went, Paddington keeps going, many stories and two films in now, this being the latest in his series of adventures.There are seven chapters in the book, all loosely connected by continuity beats, but each largely stand-alone delightful. The adventures are simple and quaint, including a downpour ruining a car trip to post a letter, a gardening mishap, a birthday party, and a variety show. But this easy charm, achieved by sheer warmth emanating from Paddington and his family, is worth quite a lot, especially as all this optimism seems effortless and real, supported by the fact that Mr. Brown, the father of the family, is still a sarcastic run-of-the-mill dad, balanced out by the ever-joyous bear.Reading this book brought me back to times when I was a kid and gulped down piles of stories about Winnie, fairy tales, and comic books. It's a throwback to a time when life consisted of sunshine and birdsongs and sure, it's naive, it's escapism at its most basic. But it works, it works one hundred percent. I loved this and I definitely see why Paddington is such an icon and why people love him.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I was a great Paddington fan when young - I am afraid this book probably proves you should never go back. To be clear, I have awarded no stars not because I found the book so dreadful but because I did not finish it, in fact I didn't even finish the first story. As soon as I started reading it, it was clear that Michael Bond had tried to update the stories but it was equally clear even from those first few pages that he had not succeeded. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'35186053', u'Sexy Naked Intimacy 8 - 80 Pictures of Female Flowers: Shameless Girls - Pussy Close-Up - Wide Open Legs', u' ', u'\n16705251\nHornyGirl\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16705251.HornyGirl\n2.83\n40\n6\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'19322740', u'No Boundaries', u' ', u'\n29795\nAllison Hobbs\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29795.Allison_Hobbs\n4.25\n5068\n597\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'Just out of law school, Jaguar is deep in debt and takes a bartending job as an easy way to make money before he gets on the fast-track of corporate law.

She met him when she was eleven and even if her mother knew how he was (dominant and all that), she let him be around her daughter ( stupid stupid stupid ). From then on, he controlled their lives, their behaviours, how to eat, what to eat, what to wear...etcetera. He\'s a rich and powerful man and he always bought new things (jewellery, luxury clothes) He brainwashed completely that little girl who just wanted someone to love her; and it was frustrating to see it when you know his intentions are so evil and you already know what\'s probably going to happen. He destroyed her links with her family (biological father/ and her mother) and made her think she needed him (tss). What I feel about that man...On the other hand, Jaguar, is a guy who just finished (or almost) law school and want to be a corporate lawyer. However, he has lots of debts and need a job for summer; that\'s how he became a bartender, meet lots of people (lots of women drooling over his body and smile... Some of them are kind of creepy...) and also Fonia. When she entered that bar, he was immediately drawn to her not just physically but also emotionally and Jaguar know he wants her in his life and not just for one night...(which is so not  like him) I found that Fonia was sort of a pain in the a**. I don\'t even know how to explain it, she was just so naive when it comes to "Mr. Lord" and I can understand it considering he manipulate her to be his perfect little pet obeying him all the time but I just wanted to shake her and tell her to WAKE UP FOR GOOD. (Sometimes, it\'s like in an horror movie, you know? When you scream at the girl "No no no, don\'t do that! NO! DON\'T OPEN THAT DOOR!" But she does it anyway, and you\'re like "Hey, this isn\'t my fault, girl. I\'ve warned you.) For the erotic part of the book, well, it is FULL of sex scenes, seriously. There were lots of it (either Fonia or Jaguar) but don\'t think it\'s a story only based on that, because it isn\'t. There is a real story behind all this, with Fonia and Jaguar trying to put her out of reach of this crazy sadistic man (fans of BDSM probably won\'t find Mr. Lord crazy and all that but I think there are limits... When the guy imposed himself in her life ten years earlier so that he can use her sexually later... Hum.)I loved the part when the main characters meet again. Jag became all protective around her to save her from that man and they\'re helping each other. YAY.  He became again a badass (but a loving one) and I liked it ;). About Curt... poor him. (view spoiler)[(He\'s in a hospital, Can\'t speak, can\'t move ...)  (hide spoiler)] It is just so damn sad and unfair for him ! We don\'t really know him (just his history) but I really like him anyway.Enjoy :). \n', u'\n           \n           No Boundaries: A Review (please note that this book is being reviewed based on an advanced uncorrected proof copy)First off, I want to state that as always with Ms. Hobbs, No Boundaries was a wild ride. While this was an ARC copy of the book, I must say there were no editing issues and the writing is clear and precise. Now, on to the meat and potatoes. The book starts off with a bang and I mean that in every sense of the word. Starting off we meet our male protagonist, Jaguar Jackson. I liked Jag almost immediately, mainly because he made no excuses about who he was. He is a young man who loves sexual gratification and made no qualms about going after it. I appreciated the aspect of him being a male in dire need of work so he could pay off his college debt.Normally, we see females in books that are in this predicament, but I appreciate Ms. Hobbs for, once again, thinking outside of the box. While upon first introduction you may think Jag to be a complex character, but as you read on you begin to see that he\'s a man who speaks his mind and goes after what he wants, no holds barred. Jag ends up taking a job that his friend, Sharif, tells him about at this bar called The Dive. Now, we all know how Ms. Hobbs works and this dive was the perfect setting for her to write about some freaky escapades that we can all enjoy. It is here at this bar that we meet some pretty ah... "interesting" characters. You have Rat-Face, Buddha, an old white couple that\'s trying to pick up anything on two legs willing to go back to a hotel with them and get it on, Bee Sting, a black woman married to a white man who likes to watch her have sex with black men (yeah, you read that right), and whole slew of other colorful characters you won\'t soon forget.Surprisingly, one of my favorite characters from the book is one who never utters a word in the book, Curt. I won\'t say too much about him, I\'ll save you that surprise. Let\'s just say Curt was the one who brought me back down to earth each and every time Ms. Hobbs took this rollercoaster to the top.Next we meet Fonia. For some reason I kept calling her Fiona in my head, but that\'s neither here nor there. We meet Fonia when she was just eleven years old. Her mother is working for a man by the name of Mr. Lord. I can tell you, almost immediately, I didn\'t like the man. I knew he was up to no good as soon as he bestowed his first set of gifts upon the little girl and started calling her princess. I wanted to strangle Fonia\'s mom for recognizing what this man was doing and still allowing him to come around her child as he did. But then again, I felt sorry for the woman because obviously she had mental issues to allow Mr. Lord to "Lord" over her the way she did.By the time Fonia was thirteen she was starting to smell herself a little bit and this is where I wanted to take a paddle and beat Mr. Lord across his darn head with it. Ugh. Ms. Hobbs does an excellent job of taking you through the years and showing how Mr. Lord took the time to develop and mold Fonia into the submissive mess she was. By the time she was sixteen, he had her eating out the palm of his hands and as you read you will find I mean this in every sense of the word. Mr. Lord was so good at manipulating Fonia that it turned her mother into a retched mess. And for the life of me I could not understand why this grown woman, Fonia\'s mother, allowed this man to take control of her daughter as such.I stopped feeling sorry for Fonia\'s mother a few chapters in because she was a grown woman and was doing everything willingly. So if she wanted to have the kind of relationship she had with Mr. Lord, then so be it. But instead of her protecting her daughter, she seemingly turned a blind eye to it and gave this man free reign.Now the synopsis states that Jag is supposed to meet Fonia and she is supposed to offer him a job at a private party. That is not the case, however, as it is his friend Sharif that tells him about the job and offers to put him on. When Fonia and Jag finally meet, I expect it to be a little more interaction between them but, surprisingly, there wasn\'t. Ms. Hobbs takes us back to their everyday lives which included Jag\'s adventures at the bar and Fonia dealing with the fallout behind the news Mr. Lord delivers to her. When Mr. Lord reveals to Fonia his plans, it sends her into almost an emotional melt down which causes her venture out on her own for the first time in life. For the last ten or so years she had been under Mr. Lord\'s lock and key.Here is where things started to annoy me a bit. Once Fonia is out on her own, let\'s just say the book started to read like one of Zane\'s earlier novels, Addicted and/or Nervous. This annoyed me because, as stated before, I was expecting Ms. Hobbs to explore the relationship between Fonia and Jag more, but it never occurred. Fast forward to Jag bar tending the second private party (by now it\'s close to the end of the book), and this is where his and Fonia\'s storyline picks back up. This is also after Mr. Lord finds Fonia and makes her move out of the apartment she was in and back into the place he\'s provided for her. From the first party Jag attends you can tell he wasn\'t really feeling the atmosphere of the place, so it was no surprise that when he found the woman he had been hoping to run into again being served a severe punishment that he rushes in to save the day.Most of the time, through Jag `s escapades that had nothing to do with Fonia, he still showed the audience how he was crushing Fonia which was odd considering they\'d only met twice and each time was brief. By the time we get to Fonia and Jag, the book is coming to an end and seemed a bit rushed at that point. I really liked the character Jag and, even when she annoyed and mildly disgusted me, I thought the character Fonia was well developed. The fact that Sharif gave Jag a warning about rescuing Mr. Lord\'s "property" and taking her away from him, I was expecting Mr. Lord to be more of a man than he turned out to be. All in all, I really wished the storyline between Jag and Fonia could have taken the place of the storyline between Rayna and Jag or even some of Jag\'s sexual escapades. I really didn\'t get the method behind the madness of Ms. Hobbs not giving us more of their storyline and I really didn\'t get one of the ending scenes when Fonia tells Jag the truth about her sexual appetite. Jag goes to take a shower and comes out a new man willing to satisfy Fonia\'s every need when he\'d just been thoroughly disgusted by her warped way of thinking just moments before.In the end, I give No Boundaries three and a half stars. Even with my gripes, Ms. Hobbs does what she does best: think outside of the box and gives us a story that leaves us either wanting more or scratching our heads thinking, what the hell did I just read? And believe me when I tell you, that\'s a good thing.\n         ', u'\n           \n           (This review originally appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer)It\u2019s a dark world that Allison Hobbs writes about in her latest book. A dark, perverted world that most people know little or nothing about. A dark, perverted world about which, I knew ahead of time, I would find distasteful to read. \tI was wrong. Forget Fifty Shades of Grey, I\u2019ve become fascinated with the Fifty Shades of Allison. \tNo Boundaries \u2013 the eighteenth novel written by Philadelphia native, Allison Hobbs \u2013 explores the world of BDSM (That\u2019s Bondage, Discipline, and Sadomasochism for those of you who don\u2019t know.) through the eyes of a young female devotee and a young male disgusted with even the idea of it. \tFonia Jenkins is only 11 when she meets her mother\u2019s employer \u2013 the mysterious Mr. Lord \u2013 for the first time. He\u2019s handsome, wealthy, and \u201cexudes masculine authority,\u201d and on their first meeting showers her with presents, telling her he\u2019s pleased to meet \u201csuch a good girl.\u201d When Fonia realizes her mother\u2019s usually aggressive demeanor becomes passive in Mr. Lord\u2019s presence, she emulates the behavior and is rewarded with even more gifts. \tFonia, though, is mystified about the nature of her mother\u2019s relationship with Mr. Lord. She\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019re not boyfriend and girlfriend \u2013 neither she nor her mother ever call him anything but \u201cMr. Lord\u201d \u2013 yet he moves them into a townhouse and stops by, for a short time, every evening. One night she peeks into her mother\u2019s bedroom and witnesses Mr. Lord beating her mother with a wooden paddle. The next morning, Fonia sees her mother sporting a brand new pair of diamond earrings. To Fonia\u2019s surprise, Mr. Lord presents her an identical pair, calling her his \u201clittle princess\u201d when she politely thanks him for the gift. As years go by he continues to spoil her, buying her expensive clothing and jewelry, and paying her tuition at a swanky private school. \tInitially Fonia sees Mr. Lord as a father-figure, but as she grows older her feelings change and she begins competing with her mother for his affection. Realizing Mr. Lord is displeased the few times her mother disagrees with him, Fonia determines to stay pleasant and agreeable. And the more docile she becomes, the more she is awarded. He proudly tells her one day: \u201cI enjoy molding you into the perfect little submissive.\u201d \tJaguar Jackson was raised in the mean streets of North Philadelphia and was hustling by the time he was thirteen. But when his best friend is gunned down and almost killed, Jag realizes he needs to turn his life around. He attends college on a basketball scholarship, then gets a law degree in New York; but, at twenty-seven, he returns to Philadelphia \u2013 broke. He\u2019s due to start a paid internship at a mid-size law firm in September in order to get experience before taking his bar examination, but needs a summer job to pay his rent until then. When a childhood buddy offers him a gig bartending at a local dive, Jaguar reluctantly takes him up on his offer. The tips are good and he meets an eclectic group of regulars, including an obese male wannabe porn star, a horny biker chick who wants to take him to bed while her boyfriend watches, and an elderly couple constantly seeking hard young bodies for a threesome. Well-endowed, and always horny, the good looking Jag has plenty of opportunities to satisfy his over-active sex drive. \tOne night a beautiful young woman walks in the bar \u2013 one much more cultured and refined then the usual clientele. Jaguar is immediately smitten with the woman, sensing in her a vulnerability that appeals to his male ego. He finds out her name is Fonia, but little else. Though she only stays a short time, she promises to return the following evening. When she fails to do so he is devastated; certain he\u2019ll never see her again.\tShortly afterward Jaguar\u2019s buddy approaches him about bartending at a private sex parties, but when he tells Jaguar of the events that occur at the parties \u2013 including bondage, and S&M \u2013 Jaguar\u2019s narrow-minded manner makes him rescind the offer. \tBut when he becomes desperate for more money, Jaguar goes back to his friend, promising his prudish attitude won\u2019t affect his work. \t Like her mentor, Zane, Hobbs is known for the sexually explicit content of her books, and No Boundaries is no exception. Make no mistake about it, the sex in No Boundaries is both abundant and hot. But what separates this book from many others dealing with BDSM is the character development, and the detailing of how a submissive can groomed from childhood. \tA somewhat disturbing tale, but an utterly fascinating one. \n', u'\n           \n           Rating: 2 Divaz StarzSynopsis: A cross between Shades of Grey and Z-Rated, No Boundaries takes readers on an unforgettable journey as a young law school graduate stumbles into an alternative lifestyle full of naughty pleasures.

During his stint as a bartender, Jag is exposed to various entertainment and flirtatious women until a chance encounter with Fiona. Where this relationship and story lead is very confusing to readers and inconsistencies come to light.The synopsis of this book and the actual storyline are vastly different and will definitely have the reader confused when first reading this book. The book starts out with Jag seeking employment until his internship starts and his childhood friend is the person that offers him the opportunity to make extra cash bartending at private parties, not Fiona. While at the same time Jag is acclimating himself with his bartending job, the author does flashbacks of Fiona growing up and showing how she was introduced to bondage and submission. It was a while before Jag and Fiona got together and Jag\u2019s view of bondage and submission were inconsistent. The author did a good job developing Fiona\u2019s character, however some of the escapades Fiona was involved and Jag\u2019s situation were unrealistic, which did not make for a good read. I felt Jag as well as Fiona were impulsive and that Fiona\u2019s path was so extreme that it was just unbelievable. This was my first book by this author and while I did not enjoy this book, I will look for other stories by this author.\n', u'\n           \n           From Bondage to Freedom"No Boundaries" is the story of Fonia and Jaguar. Fonia is a young beauty bound by a man who claims he has only her best interest at heart. Jaguar is a man working to make ends meet and doing what he has to do to get ahead. They meet totally by chance and there is instantly an attraction, but something is holding Fonia back. See how manipulation, lies, and bondage can really mess up an innocent soul and the lengths one will go to free this bound soul.\u201cNo Boundaries\u201d really delves into the life of being a dominatrix versus a subservient and willing participant. It shows you how when a person has a lot of money and power they can easily rule over and control a person. I felt like it was well written, very descriptive and really opened my eyes to the lengths some people will go to, all in the name of control. I really liked Jag\'s character; he had his faults but he had integrity.Very good read, a few errors but it was still a very good novel.Reviewed by: Lisa M.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'20111831', u'A Divine Word from a Revelation', u' ', u'\n5184436\nRuben Gabriel\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5184436.Ruben_Gabriel\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'12865634', u'Gott schu\u0308tze dieses Haus', u' ', u'\n1402383\nElizabeth  George\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235518043p5/1402383.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235518043p2/1402383.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1402383.Elizabeth_George\n3.96\n231153\n14453\n', u'2011', u'', u'', u'', u'Jahrhunderte lag ein Dorf im englischen Yorkshire im Dornr\xf6schenschlaf \u2013 bis ein brutaler Mord die Idylle st\xf6rt: Der Dorfpfarrer entdeckt die enthauptete Leiche seines treuen Sch\xe4fchens William Teys in einer Scheune.

And so far he does not appear to be an alcoholic or have any other unappealing trait as most MCs in crime books do these days. (although as this book was written in 1988 nearly everyone smokes all the time)2. Due also to the date it was written there is a lovely historical aspect to everything. It's all done without mobiles and computers, and life in general seems calmer.3. The story is good, gritty and totally gripping. The last scenes in the psychiatric hospital made me reach for the tissues.4. The author knows how to write. Just occasionally she gets a bit carried away with setting her scenes but she does it so nicely I can forgive her.5. Best of all there are a LOT more books in the series. I love a good series:) If you have not read this yet I strongly recommend it!\n", u'\nOFFICIAL BLURBTo this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale\'s lush green valleys. Three hundred years ago, as legend goes, the frightened Yorkshire villagers smothered a crying babe in Keldale Abbey, where they\'d hidden to escape the ravages of Cromwell\'s raiders.Now into Keldale\'s pastoral web of old houses and older secrets comes Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton. Along with the redoubtable Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, Lynley has been sent to solve a savage murder that has stunned the peaceful countryside. For fat, unlovely Roberta Teys has been found in her best dress, an axe in her lap, seated in the old stone barn beside her father\'s headless corpse. Her first and last words were "I did it. And I\'m not sorry."Yet as Lynley and Havers wind their way through Keldale\'s dark labyrinth of secret scandals and appalling crimes, they uncover a shattering series of revelations that will reverberate through this tranquil English valley\u2014and in their own lives as well. Susan Elizabeth George is an American author writing murder mysteries set in Great Britain. She\'s doing a good job, since she mastered the English dialogue so well, that I would never have suspected her being American.A friend gave me the first book as a gift, and after finishing it, I ventured off into the author\'s other works, just to discover that it was the beginning of 19 books in this Inspector Lynley series. Digging deeper into the history of the series, I also discovered that it was turned into a popular television series, covering several seasons. Let\'s face it, the Brits love their murder mysteries and they know how to bring these stories alive. I\'m really a sucker for it. Cannot leave them alone.The easy flow of the plot and story line keeps the reader committed to the prose. It reminds me of the cozy Agatha Christie novels. The author managed to built accurate characters. For instance, Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley is truly noble in his conduct, apart from having the appropriate bloodline as well. Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers acts authentically as a product of the lower income groups with less veneer and polish. Her people-skills are also a problem in her interaction with the public.Since I am not a fan or groupie of the British class system, I couldn\'t care less who were blessed by birth to be better than the rest of us, thus did not get excited about the possible lords and ladies tripling down the word-lanes of this narrative. I also did not hail Barbara Havers as the ultimate representative of the working class, due to her unresolved issues driving me a little bit bonkers. That doesn\'t mean that her character was not authentic, on the contrary. The overall emphasizing of the class system should have been expected, we\'re in Britain after all, but it did scratch my back with a steel brush from time to time. And then there was the depiction of the poor  fat (and) unlovely Roberta Teys as a mortally despicable soul. All the grown ups in the village were guilty of her condition and her conduct. Nobody cared to listen when she tried to find some help. The only solution she had to protect herself, was to eat....and eat.... and eat. When she was finally successful and the focus moved from her to someone else she loved, she made a plan on her own. The grown ups turned their heads away from the revolting, obese little girl, hoping the problem will go away. They turned their backs on a lonely scared little girl. She had no one to trust. It makes me wonder: are you allowed by society, or by yourself, to have chubby, happy-faced obese friends? No? Well, it\'s a sad world we\'re living in, isn\'t it?So yes, my hackles were a bit up with these insecure anti-obesity lot, a bunch of scoundrels if you ask me, and that includes the Catholic priest. But that\'s my problem. Everybody in the world has problems, that one is mine, for sure.And then I wonder: if you decapitate someone in self defense, can it be regarded as murder? I don\'t think so. Even if it was premeditated, I probably would have been an accomplice in this instance! Worse, if I was in on the deal, some people, and I am not naming names here, would have hanged from the rafters by their stems, like pumpkins.Now, that was not the main focus of my reading experience. It\'s just a \'so by the way\' - observation. The overall experience was a good one. I enjoyed it. And I will certainly read the second book. After that I will have to see...But really, any murder mystery groupie, like yours truly, will simply grab onto this series and release the breaks! Just go for it. It\'s one of the best!\n', u'\n           \n           I initially saw the television adaptation of this book on PBS Mystery!. I was moved by the dark, Yorkshire setting and the budding friendship of Lynley and Havers. It had such a gritty conclusion, that I went to the library the next day and checked out the next book in the series. That was almost 9 years ago! After finishing book six in the series last year, I felt it was time to read the book that started it all. I can\'t believe I waited so long! Thus far, this my favorite book in the series! From the beginning, there\'s an onslaught of disappointments and ghosts among the protagonists. Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who has recently been demoded to a uniform policewoman, is put back into the detective role when a "delicate" case is brought before Scotland Yard. To her utter horror, she is partnered with the infamous Inspector Thomas Lynley. Apart from having a well-known reputation as a rogue, he also happens to be the eight earl of Asherton, which only widens the barrier between the staunch, blue collar Barbara. He isn\'t his usual carefree self either. He\'s just watched his best friend marry his ex-fiance and seen them off on their honeymoon. The case? Set your mind to the gray, windy moors of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. There, in the sleepy Yorkshire village of Keldale, a respectable farmer and his dog are found decapitated inside a barn. Seated next to the headless body, is the farmer\'s daughter. Found in her best dress and an axe in her lap, her only words when she is found are "I did it. And I\'m not sorry." Open and shut case? I think not! The village priest and locals maintain that as sweet and caring as she was, Roberta Teys couldn\'t have possibly murdered her own father in such a brutal way. What follows is a careful investigation into dark closets and past sins. What makes this book so much more than a Scotland Yard mystery is George\'s ability to marry historical and literary elements with the here and now. It\'s amazing! I didn\'t expect to find so many allusions to Shakespeare and the Brontes, or that they would be critical to understanding the whole case. Check this book out sometime. If you don\'t have the patience, I recommend the BBC\'s The Inspector Lynley Mysteries television series.\n', u'\n           \n           UPDATE 2/1/17 ...I found "A Great Deliverance" as outstanding on second read as I did the first time around. My 5***** rating remains unchanged. George\'s ability to present an evolving and developing character is outstanding for any genre, but even more so for a mystery story, where character is often far subordinate to plot. This is especially true of the characters who continue in George\'s series but also for the the main one-off\'s. We don\'t ever get it all at once, but in pieces, each one adding to what builds into a nuanced understanding of the character\'s strengths and weaknesses.George also has a great facility for moving quickly from one venue/character to another while always assuring the reader does not lose the thread of the story. This avoids ever having scenes which are too long. We are always dealing with a fresh aspect of the story.Finally, a criticism, sort of. George\'s descriptions of places is superb, but I think she sometimes overdoes it with unnecessary detail, which I usually skimmed. PREVIOUS COMMENTS ... This is the first of the Lynley-Havers stories, and also the first that I am re-reading. I hope I don\'t remember too much of the plot (it\'s been 10 years at least) but my real purpose in re-reading is to study George\'s writing techniques. Her use of setting, development of character, and plot surprises, among other elements, are superb. For fans of Elizabeth George who are also writers, I recommend Write Away: One Novelist\'s Approach to Fiction and the Writing Life.George unfolds the layers of a complicated story in a way that builds the emotion and tension but never leaves the reader confused. There are many characters whose roles keep evolving, but George always gives the reader the 2-3 words that assure you always know the connection of the character to previous points in the story. (NOTE: This contrasts so vividly with books like Wolf Hall and The Casual Vacancy (first half) where the authors make no such effort and the reader is often left adrift.)Much of the emotion in "A Great Deliverance" comes from the relationship between Lynley and Havers, as each helps the other deal with debilitating attitudes that threaten their personal and professional futures.I didn\'t realize until very recently that this was George\'s first novel. Wow!\n         ', u'\n           \n           Rating: 4 solid stars of fiveThe Publisher Says: To this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale\'s lush green valleys. Three hundred years ago, as legend goes, the frightened Yorkshire villagers smothered a crying babe in Keldale Abbey, where they\'d hidden to escape the ravages of Cromwell\'s raiders.Now into Keldale\'s pastoral web of old houses and older secrets comes Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton. Along with the redoubtable Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, Lynley has been sent to solve a savage murder that has stunned the peaceful countryside. For fat, unlovely Roberta Teys has been found in her best dress, an axe in her lap, seated in the old stone barn beside her father\'s headless corpse. Her first and last words were "I did it. And I\'m not sorry."Yet as Lynley and Havers wind their way through Keldale\'s dark labyrinth of secret scandals and appalling crimes, they uncover a shattering series of revelations that will reverberate through this tranquil English valley\u2014and in their own lives as well.My Review: The first book of the ongoing Inspector Lynley/DS Havers series, this book reads more like the fourth or fifth in the series, which I intend as a compliment. The author is very assured as she tells the story of a murder in an idyllic North Country village, one that seems from the start to be open-and-shut. As always in a mystery, though, there are many many twists and turns to the tale. Family secrets from every imaginable quarter. Horrible crimes past, as well as present, suppurate through the skin of the story, causing the characters to blanch regularly. (Readers too.) Lynley, an urbane and polished public school/Oxford First beauty, comes alive as a wounded man of many facets and a sharp, critical eye. His emotional acuity is high order; his past, as we know it so far, explains that quite well. Havers, who here in the first book is presented in all her hideous glory as receiving a Very Last Chance at being permanently assigned to Scotland Yard\'s prestigious Criminal Investigation Division, seems hell-bent for leather on tossing the opportunity away because, as Lynley says, "{she\'s} mad at him" and justifiably so.But, in patented mystery fashion, miscreants are punished and those less culpable find some measure of relief from their hideous, tormented sadness. Hard to argue with those results since they occur so seldom in reality.Is murder always wrong? Can you be sure of your answer? I know I\'ve never been able to be absolutist about the topic. Reading this book, I felt absolutism and unimpeded judgment flapping their flightless wings desperately, sensing their ever-deeper immersion into the stock-pot of my subconscious.I don\'t know about you, but there are times I think a good murdering rampage would do the world a power of good. Problem is, the bad guys have the weapons.And reading this book, well, I just don\'t know that justice as practiced by the courts and described by the laws can really do a good enough job. And believe you me, that thought scares the bejabbers out of me. It makes me think about the nature of crime, and of punishment, and of the intersection of the two; it makes me afraid of the apparently boundless human capacity to commit horrible acts; and it makes me think hard about what I want out of my time on this planet...and whether I\'m doing a single thing to make that want become fact.A very great deliverance indeed, this book. In entertaining me, it also grew me up a little more.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'28975150', u"An Edition of Philip Massinger's Duke of Milan ..", u'212', u'\n183835\nPhilip Massinger\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1395071933p5/183835.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1395071933p2/183835.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/183835.Philip_Massinger\n3.41\n176\n33\n', u'2015', u'12', u'6', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Instead, he destroys himself through his obsessive attachment to his wife, not as a person, but merely as a lovely object belonging exclusively to him. Embarking upon a dangerous political mission, he leaves orders to have her killed in the event that she survives him; she finds out about his orders, and her attitude toward him--once dutifully faithful--begins to change, setting in motion a series of events that bring about the catastrophe. Some of my favorite moments in Renaissance drama are those that involve dead women, dress-up, and death. (In fact, my two favorite scenes of all the plays I have read--excluding Shakespeare--are Vindice\'s speech to the skull of his dead mistress and the subsequent use of this same skull--now poisoned--as a murder weapon against the Duke.) "The Duke of Milan" presents the reader with a powerful scene of this type, in which a calculating courtier disquised as a physician rouges the cheeks of a dead beauty in order to convince her madman husband that she is still alive. The moral is both heavy-handed and effective, as only a Renaissance drama can be.Unfortunately, the end of the play is rushed, and the final catastrophe seems no more than an afterthought. With an effective conclusion, this might have been a fine play.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Really illuminating on the Renaissance gendered power dynamic - highlights the paradox of men\'s simultaneously submissive and dominating stance towards women in marriage.

This is a dark disturbing thriller that has some fantastic twists that I didn't see coming. It was a race to the end because the suspense drew me in. The characters were done very well. It kept me turning the pages till the very end.An engaging suspense where past and present collide. Over twelve years ago young women who lived on the streets were being killed in New Orleans and now the killings have started again in Virginia. State trooper Riley Tatum is first on the scene and what she sees brings back fuzzy memories of 7 days she cannot remember from 12 years ago. Seems she was the only one that got away. The mystery was good and the story had many pieces that didn't seem to fit together at first but once they were all put together you could see how they all lead to the The Shark \u2013 the person responsible for so many deaths.WOW I did not see that coming-the bad guy surprised me. When it got close I was thinking no way but, it was him. This is my first book by her and am looking forward to more. I'm looking forward to the next one in this series and hope there are many more. Calling all mystery and thriller fans that like a dark psychological thriller. Gripping Suspense and recommend it to all Angela Marsons and Stacy Green fans.\n", u'\n           \n           \u201cThe Shark\u201d by Mary BurtonI believe romantic suspense lovers are going to be thrilled with Mary Burton\u2019s new series, The Forgotten Files.The first installment, \u201cThe Shark,\u201d is centered around Riley Tatum, a Virginia State Trooper, who has worked exceedingly hard to get her life back on track after running away from home as a teenager and getting herself into a nightmarish situation she was lucky to have survived.She now specializes in \u2018tracking,\u2019 with her faithful dog, Cooper, and is adopting a troubled teen named Hannah. Her life has finally stabilized, until she finds a murdered prostitute with a hand of playing cards on her person, who also happens to bear a striking resemblance to Riley. To complicate matters, Clay Bowman, a man Riley once had tender feelings for, has insinuated himself into her investigation, believing Riley is the target of a serial killer known as \u201cThe Shark.\u201d Hoping to keep her troubled past from becoming public knowledge, Riley reluctantly teams up with Bowman to discover who it is playing high-stakes poker games with the lives of young women. This story is a traditional romantic suspense novel, but will also appeal to thriller fans too. The plot is very disturbing, featuring some of the most depraved bad guys I\u2019ve encountered in recent memory. The plot twists shocked me so hard I nearly lost my breath! This one may not be for the faint of heart, as there are forensic details and the story is pretty dark. However, Riley is a fantastic character and her tenacity is inspiring. I enjoyed Bowman\u2019s more low key approach, but bristled on occasion when he made decisions without consulting Riley. However, the two ended up working together quite well, and made a good team. The romance is slow to build, and while it is not the prominent thread in the story, it is a nice second-chance-at-love story which gave me hope that Riley will finally have a chance at having a real family and some long overdue happiness. \u201c4-stars\u201d!Reviewed by Julie Whiteley for Suspense Magazine \n', u'\n3.75 "Life-and-Death Game" StarsTwelve years ago, Riley Tatum disappeared from the street. When some one offered her a bottled water, she\u2019d taken it. that was the last thing she remembered. She lost seven days of her life. But then she found five playing cards in her back pocket. Now after these years, she\u2019s become a police officer and she has a case like that but with one difference: the girls are dead and one the back of cards was written loser!Clay Bowman had first met Riley five years ago. It had been six months after his wife died and he was training a group of police officers, including Riley. She was one of her best students. He\u2019d had a chance to love her once and had tossed it away. Now after five years, they must work on the same case but his assignment is to protect her!I loved its writing. It took you on the edge of your seat all the time. But I had a problem. I like my Suspense books with some romantic aspects! Yeah, Clay and Riley attracted to each other but you could feel no passion, tension, angst, attraction or love between them. They didn\u2019t use any endearment words even, let alone L word!The story is told in multiple POV, 3rd person. it can be read as a standalone. It was well-paced, but I had a little problem with the characters\u2019 relationship albeit if you can name it relationship! But all in all, it was a good read and I enjoyed it. hope you like it as well!\n         ', u'\nVery disappointed.Got this free with audio. Narration is very bad, goes to high volume to whisper. Trained police dog Cooper is kept in a cage at home, why?\n         ', u'\n3.5 StarsFor twelve years Riley Tatum has eluded the grasps of a serial killer, and she hasn\'t even known it. But now the killer is back, this time with plans to never let Riley go again. With the help of ex-FBI Agent, and former lover, Clay Bowman, Riley starts a dangerous cat and mouse game with a killer hellbent on getting to her. The Shark was an intriguing tale of how the past can follow you to the present. I loved getting to know Riley and learning how she survived a hard life and always managed to leap over the hurdles that life threw at her. She had a strong personality and it made her easy to like. Clay was the same, easily likable, and I liked the role his character had within this story. His alpha-ness never took over, rather it made for a captivating story between him and Riley. The end was a little predictable and I figured out what the "big secret" was. It didn\'t take too much enjoyment away from the book, but because of what the secret was I was a little meh about the end. Overall, I very much enjoyed this book and it reminded me why I like romantic suspense books so much. I haven\'t read Mary Burton in a long while but I definitely plan on sticking to this series and not forgetting about it. \n         '], 0]!!!![u'22373693', u'Telehealth: Ethical and Legal Practice for Mental Health Professionals, 8 Credits', u' ', u'\n7970398\nRobert Yourell\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7970398.Robert_Yourell\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'35259797', u'Ale snad i pro toto jsme \u017eili, ne?', u'463', u'\n16899482\nMilan Petruska\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16899482.Milan_Petruska\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2017', u'', u'', u'Slon', u'Osobn\xe1 kore\u0161pondencia Milana Petruska a Martina B\xfatoru, dvoch zn\xe1mych sociol\xf3gov, z doby ich akademick\xe9ho vyhnanstva.

Dreaming is one of the most interesting topics out there. The book was not at all what I expected, from the first line of the book, "I killed two kids at school today." to the last lines which leave the reader furiously turning back pages to understand the ending.\tThe main character and lone narrator of the book is a boy named Michael Terny, a sophomore in high school who is extremely overweight and is bullied relentlessly by his fellow classmates. To make matters worse Michael is at his seventh school in four years. His father is continuously moving in order to find some sort of peace after the death of Michael\'s mother who was killed in a car cash caused by a drunken driver. Again to make Michaels situation worse the drunk driver was let off without even a fine because of a technicality with the way his blood alcohol content was recorded that night by the police. Michaels only escape has been through his dreams.\tMichael can lucid dream, a phenomenon in which the dreamer realizes he or she is dreaming and can start to control certain aspects of their dream. This is how he escapes from his real life problems. In his dreams he is whoever he wants to be and wields god like powers. What keeps Michael going when he is awake is his step-mother Mary who cares for him and is very supportive of Michael. Only in the closing pages of the book is the problem with Mary revealed. \tThe book opens with Michaels first day at a new school, things look like they might turn around for him. He meets Leah, a caring, and thoughtful girl who also struggles with her weight, and they become friends. His home group teacher Mr. Atkins is also very supportive of Michael. However, as with every school their are bullies; Jamie Asher is a classic teenage bully. Jamie is insecure, having problems with his appearance, and at home. He channels his anger out at people like Michael. Another bully Michael encounters is the Martin Leechy. Martin is smart, attractive, and good at sports, the kind of person Michael says he would like to be. Martin is a very confusing character who talks in riddles and metaphors. At first it appears Martin is just another bully in Michaels path but later in the book he is revealed to be much more or much less depending on your perspective. \tNear the end of the novel Michael starts to stand up for himself against bullies and decides to go to the school social on his first Friday at his new school. With the reader routing for Michael to find happiness, he goes to the school social and it appears he can begin to over come his problems. That is until like the ending of a horror movie when you think the danger is past the main characters whole world is turned inside out, backwards, upside down, and rightside-left in this mind bending ending that will leave the reader desperately flipping back to key pages to understand the book\'s conclusion.\n', u"\n           \n           It's utterly impossible to write a review of this book without spoiling a crucial plot twist. Personally, I think readers NEED to know about this plot twist in advance. This is why I haven't hidden this review.Dreamrider is about Michael, a teenage boy who moves to a new school. Michael is a total loner: he's the kind of kid who always get teased and bullied, no matter what he does. But his peers don't realise that Michael has a secret power \u2013 he has the power to slip into a magical dream world where he can refashion everything around him using his thoughts. Or not. Because - TWIST ENDING! - it turns out that Michael actually has a mental illness and many of the characters and events were hallucinations.I totally agree that mental health is an important issue for young people. I also agree that novels are a great way to explore the topic in a way that helps to build empathy for people with mental illnesses. So why exactly did the author choose to conceal the truth about the main character's condition for so long? That foolish choice results in this book being marketed as if it was science-fiction. Readers go into this book expecting a story where an underdog has magical powers that enable him to rise up against the people who victimise him, only to be told that it was all a lie. Only to be told that Michael was never a hero. He was exactly what all his bullies said all along: a fat, friendless loser. To say this was intensely frustrating and disappointing is a gross understatement. Moreover, what sort of message does this book send? That people with mental illnesses are losers who should be pitied? Last time I checked, they were ordinary people. The author would have done infinitely better to emphasise ways in which the main character was an everyman or a popular kid in order to challenge a few stereotypes and really drive home the message that mental illness can and does affect everyone. Such a narrative choice would have reduced the stigma that people with mental illness face, instead of actively contributing to it.Concealing the truth about the main character's mental illness totally undercuts the author's intended meaning in other ways, too. This book doesn't raise awareness about the true effects of mental illness, nor does it invite readers to see beyond the diagnosis to the ordinary person underneath, nor does it ask the reader to empathise with the daily concerns of a person living with mental illness. No. It simply cannot do any of these things because for most of the book the reader has no idea it is even about someone with a mental illness. This book actively promotes ignorance about people with mental illnesses and perpetuates many negative stereotypes. In the end, this book encourages readers to pity Michael, who is stripped of all agency and power in a book that is supposed to be all about him. The author treats mental illness as if it were a cheap plot twist in a cheesy thriller. This book is, plain and simple, exploitative.\n         ", u"\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           This is the story of Michael Terny, a young man who, along with his father moves around the country looking for a place to feel comfortable, but never finding it. When he was younger Michael's mother died in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. Ever since, his father has been distant, only talking to his son in anger and coming home drunk more often than not. Michael started eating after the accident and grew steadily more stout until he cannot enter a school without being teased, bullied and treated pretty much like a freak.However, in his most recent school he makes a friend as well as the normal enemies. He is also beginning to discover that he has a strange and wonderful power. The power to affect real life through his dreams. For a long time Michael has been able to dream lucidly, controlling everything in his dreamworld. Now, it seems, not only can he control the dreamworld, but he can control the real world too. What will he do with the power? Will he use it to get back at his enemies, or will he use it to save the world?Sounds interesting doesn't it? Well, in my opinion, don't bother with it. It is a fairly fast read, but really not worth even a small amount of time. It becomes very apparent only half way through the book (if that) that Michael Terny should be committed. His new friend, along with his stepmother and the clever bully who torments him are all completely inventions of his own mind. Nearly every interaction in the entire book is completely negated by that realization and it becomes hard to watch as Michael goes through his delusional days talking to himself, beating himself up, and from what you can picture generally acting completely insane. It is no wonder that people treated him like an abnormal freak! He wrote and answered notes to himself at his desk. He smashed his own cake into his face at lunch time, he pinched himself so hard in math class he got sent to the office.By the end of the book you can see that Michael will most likely spend the rest of his life institutionalized. Instead of thinking 'Oh my God, they were in my head this whole time, am I crazy!?' Michael accepts his invisible friends as advisers to his dream powers and basically decides that he will become a vengeful god. The last couple pages of the book are almost directly from the bible. It was a bit much. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to take away from the book. It's not good to have a god complex? People with no friends who are fat and sad that their mother has died  should  be bullied and then sent to an insane asylum? Maybe it is because I am not religious, but I just couldn't get the message.\n         ", u"\n           \n           omg seriously I was hooked from the start but the ending I don't know weather to be annoyed by it or weather I should slap myself for not seeing it earlier...\n         ", u'\n           \n           Barry Jonsberg: DreamriderBy Derek BowmanDreamrider is about a young boy named Micheal, who is a teenager who switches school every so often because he gets bullied or because he has no friends. Micheal calls himself the Dreamrider because everything that he dreams about happens in real life in the future. Micheal is a very paranormal kid and doesn\'t really like anyone. The author Barry Jnosberg brings suspense to the book asking why a lot making the readers want to keep reading. I liked this book and i think that teenagers would love to read this fun and suspenseful book that will talk and help about bullying and problems that we can overcome.Jonsberg is the author of the awesome book called "My Life as an Alphabet" which is a fun comedy that will make you laugh. Barry Jonsberg is an exciting and great author that writes books for children and young adults. In the past, Dreamrider was listed for the 2007 NSW Premier\'s Award .Jonsberg has also received other awards including the 2005 Children\'s Books Council Awards and in 2006 he won the South Australian Festival Award for Children\'s Literature. Jonsberg was born in Liverpool in 1951 where he earned two degrees in English and Psychology and became a college lecturer before he moved to Australia in 1999.Though it seems as if he has no friends, young Micheal Terny meets many new people when he arrives at his new school. Micheal doesn\'t really like the school until he meets a girl named Leah. Micheal is intrigued by Leah and wants to be her friend. As the relationship between the two strives so does the bullying. Micheal gets picked on by the kids. (mainly the boys who call him fat) He gets beat up at school and gets his lunch stolen. Leah stands up for Micheal and yells at the bullies, but even she can\'t stop them. Micheal decides to put an end to it so fights back at the kids and hurts them. He killed two kids at his old school and now at his new school he broke a kids arm who bullied him. Micheal is a very strong and powerful boy who has powers. Micheal has the ability to open up his dream world and use his powers for revenge on the kids who tease and pick on him. As the bullies get worse so does Micheal as he unleashes his powers on the bullies making them regret picking on him again.There\'s a very good lesson that comes from this story; treat others the way you want to be treated and i think that is huge in this story because Micheal just wants to be normal but everyone hates him and bullies him. The book talks about a very strong thing that people need to follow and I like that it brings this lesson into the book because everyone should deserve equal respect. Micheal changes dramatically over the book from becoming a lonely silent kid to a paranormal dangerous kid. When Micheal promises that he will "bring light to this world and help others" I felt that it was a strong message and is very odd because before he hated everyone and now he wants to help people. Dreamrider makes kids want to stand up for others and prevent bullying and will make adults very glad.\n'], 0]!!!![u'33560910', u'Coaching Kids: Practical Tips for Effective Communication', u' ', u'\n1005925\nRuth McRoberts Ward\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1005925.Ruth_McRoberts_Ward\n4.83\n6\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'31614061', u'Bulletin of the Ontario Hospitals for the Insane Volume V.08 N.03', u'66', u'\n14279801\nOntario Hospitals for the Insane\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14279801.Ontario_Hospitals_for_the_Insane\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'5', u'25', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The following Introduction will, therefore, preface both Parts, they being published separately to suit the requirements of students. <br />For both Parts the authority is Holinshed\'s Chronicle but there also existed when they were written a worthless anonymous play called The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth, containing the honourable battell of Agincourt, in which occur the leading incidents of Shakespeare\'s play. The first Part was written either in 1596 or 1597, and the second Part at all events before the 25th of February, 1598. The first Part was entered in the Stationers\' Registers by Andrew Wise, Feb. 25th, 1597-8, as "A booke intitled the Historye of Henry iiiith, with his battaile at Shrewsburye against Henry Hottspurre of the Northe, with the conceipted Mirth of Sir John Falstaffe."

Falstaff is not nearly so funny apart from Hal, Prince John is a much icier foil than the mercurial Hotspur, and Hal himself--whom we wish to like--makes himself disagreeable by stealing his dying father's crown and snubbing the fat knight we love. Yet Shakespeare, by subtle degrees, leads us to the point where we come to admire Hal and believe in his moral transformation. Images of gestation and generation abound in this very masculine play, demonstrating how many unlooked-for things may grow within the womb of time, how even the most dissolute of princes may mature into a great warrior king.\n         ", u'\n\u201cVirtue is chok\'d with foul ambition\u201d- William Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part 2, Act 3, Scene 1I was recently at a book signing for Don Winslow\'s new book The Force and he brought up his life-long fascination with Shakespeare and how the Godfather books/movies (at least the first two) are basically a retelling of Shakespeare\'s Henry IV with the moral poles flipped (with Al Pacino playing Hal and Diane Keaton as a gender-bent Falstaff). I can run with that. Anyway, Henry IV, Part 2 is fantastic. It is less playful than Henry IV, Part 1 and the comic role of Falstaff drops an octave into tragicomedy. Falstaff still possesses a comedic greatness to him, but he has suddenly seen his relationship with Hal changed at the end as Hal puts away childish things and takes up the mantle (and crown) of his father. One of my favorite of Shakespeare\'s Histories (right there with Richard III). It is a mature and serious play. Youth\'s sandbox has been replaced with the battlefield and folly has been replaced with responsibility.Favorite lines:\u201cRumour is a pipeBlown by surmises, jealousies, conjecturesAnd of so easy and so plain a stopThat the blunt monster with uncounted heads,The still-discordant wavering multitude,Can play upon it.\u201d (Prologue, Scene 1)"I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men."

I mean, sure, he's a fool and a rascal and incorrigible, but at the core of it, he and Hal were friends, weren't they?And yet, even while I hate Hal a little for his decision, I love him all the more for it and everything else. Truly, he was the best king. Not only very aware of his audience, but always playing to every side, learning the craft of people and of hard decisions.Then again, he's always known about hard decisions and all of this couldn't have been more studied and careful. Even his jests boast of tactical genius. Fanboy? Yeah. I am. Of a character. lolStill, it was a rather heart-wrenching scene with the prince and his father at the end. *sniffle*Sorry.

It is the third part of a tetralogy, preceded by Richard II and Henry IV, Part 1 and succeeded by Henry V. The play is often seen as an extension of aspects of Henry IV, Part 1, rather than a straightforward continuation of the historical narrative, placing more emphasis on the highly popular character of Falstaff and introducing other comic figures as part of his entourage, including Ancient Pistol, Doll Tearsheet and Justice Robert Shallow.

As I said, there was a lot of history to tell so Shakespeare divided it up.In this 2nd part, the battle of Shrewsbury is over, Hotspur is dead, Hal (King Henry IV's son) returns victorious. This part definitely focuses on Hal and his further passage from scandalous young bloke to a man of honour - and it is about Falstaff and how he falls from grace. This last bit can be seen most clearly because Hal and Falstaff have almost no time together. Instead, the play is divided into the part showing Falstaff who is still a petty criminal despite his vow in the previous play and the part of the prince. Falstaff's age is shown time and time again together with an ominous illness that somehow mirrors the nearing death of Henry IV himself (Falstaff mentions it once). Falstaff is behaving worse and worse (or maybe just as bad as before but it is in stark contrast of the new Hal?) but when he speaks ill of the prince (who hears him) he tries to make amends by helping against a new rebellion. The other part shows Hal still being a disappointment to his father and it is Hal's brother John who takes care of the new rebellion mentioned above (not by battle). Then, the king falls ill and seems to die, there is quite some father-son-drama but before Henry IV actually dies, they make up.In the final scene, the two story lines meet because Falstaff, hearing Hal is king, travels to London in hopes of money. In fact, it appears that all lowlives thought they'd thrive under Hal's reign but quickly learn that they were very wrong.At the end, there is even an epilogue, a 4th wall breach, that informs us of a soon-to-come new play in which Falstaff shall die and (which I think is funny) that his character was not based on a rebel called Sir John Oldcastle (apparently an anti-Catholic who nevertheless died a martyr so his descendents were outraged at the possible connection).Shakespeare again managed to bring a lot to the page/stage with this play. I think this was less humorous than the first part (except for the epilogue but I might be the only one finding that funny) but still very good. It being less humorous might have been because Shakespeare wanted to drive home the morale a bit more strongly this time (after all, a king dies)! I was somewhat disappointed about Hal still being a disappointment to his father but an immediate change might have been less realistic and might have prevented the great climax when Henry IV dies.\n"], 0]!!!![u'34769116', u'Cookbook Notebook: Blank Recipe Cookbook, 7 X 10, 100 Blank Recipe Pages', u' ', u'\n1000834\nNOT A BOOK\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1000834.NOT_A_BOOK\n4.06\n52063\n4623\n', u'2017', u'3', u'29', u'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', u'<b>Blank Cookbook with Full Table of Contents</b><br /><br />Now you can create your own cookbook with a full table of contents just like the pros do.

Each section also includes a What Should the Employee Do section which outlines a number of possible solutions to the problem. A summary called Today's Take-Aways end each section. A Survival Guide for Working with Bad Bosses is an excellent resource for employees stuck in a difficult situation. Not only does the book remind the reader that he or she is not the only one to have such circumstances but also gives them options which are often difficult to think of when stuck in the middle of a problem.

I did not like how most of solutions to the first section were variations on "If you can\'t beat them, join them!" or "Do your managers job yourself and you will be rewarded." Only in the more egregious situations (being insulted, harassed, hurt or threatened) was the employee encouraged to stand up for themselves. I was looking for more concrete tips on what to do when leadership is poor or uninformed and bad decisions are made. I don\'t want to continue to do work beyond my pay grade for years.

This book deals with all kinds of bad bosses that you will ever face in your professional life, along with the solutions & tactics on how to handle them.

Here\'s the book >> http://www.sarahnamulondo.com/wp-cont...\n', u'\n           \n           In my personal opinion, the book tells no news as for dealing with situations mentioned. Yes, it does give some practical pieces of advi\u0441e on different occasions, but yet again, all of them are pretty obvious to any adequate grown-up and there\'s no need in reading a special book on all this. What is more, I found that some ideas in this book were quite subjective and probably not suitable for everyone. "Working with Bad Bosses" tells no news: be polite, adjust, act carefully, wait, deal with it or look for another job. It does deal with real-life situations, however, provides nothing new to the reader.

It tells of a stubborn and bigoted king (James VII &amp; II) in conflict with his subjects\u2014a conflict in which he was finally forced to put aside his crown and make way for his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. Less than\xa030 years since Charles II has been restored to the throne, a king was once more deposed (although this time rather less bloodily), effectively creating the form of government that we have today: after the Revolution it was no longer possible for British monarchs to ride roughshod over the wishes of their people or to impose religion upon them. Yet, as well as creating a constitutional monarchy, it also led to the Jacobite Rebellions in Scotland and the Orange Order marches in Northern Ireland.

It's one of my favorite series and Lisbeth is hands down an all-time favorite character. My review treats this graphic novel as an adaptation of an original work, not an original or stand-alone work because that's not what it is.That being said, while I do enjoy quite a few graphic novels, I don't usually read comic versions of books because I find them lacking in content and not close enough to the original -- even more than some movie adaptations -- so they become more like condensed, spin-offs to me.I picked this up because of the badass cover art and the first few pages seemed accurate to the book. Unfortunately, it left me pretty disappointed for the above reasons and I will be returning this.This definitely does not deserve the 4- and 5-star ratings people who haven't read the books or even seen the movies have been giving it. I don't want to make this a long review since there are others out there who've already expressed the same opinions, so in a nutshell, this got 2 stars because:The character of Lisbeth was portrayed as more frail and emotional than she is in the book. She does not go dancing and she does not cry.Too many panels looked the same, like they were copied, pasted, and zoomed in even though I can tell they weren't. I actually went back to previous pages to make sure I wasn't looking at the same illustration on a different background.The art actually becomes lazy after a while. It just gets flat and less detailed as if they decided to stop shading, especially the parts with Mikael. If you're drawn in by the cover, don't expect the inside to be the same.The character's mouths aren't open when they're talking. This may seem like a minor detail, but I feel like the most basic thing an illustrator should know is to make the characters look animated, not like statues. People are just sitting there while speech bubbles are floating around them. If it weren't for the speech bubbles pointing to the tight-lipped character who's supposed to be talking, you wouldn't know whom the words belong to.Finally, too many details are just not accurate, such as the tattoo Lisbeth cuts into Bjurman.If you want a visual adaptation of the Millennium trilogy, try the Swedish films; they're accurate to the book minus a few minor details, and I personally think Noomi Rapace portrays Lisbeth flawlessly, right down to her small height, muscular build, punk hair, and icy, take-no-prisoners attitude.Review \xa9 Gally Lines 11.17.12\n         ", u'\n           \n           I am a very big fan of Stieg Larsson\'s original series, as well as the films. I was very excited to read the graphic novel adaptation, even though it seemed a bit pointless. To me, releasing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in such a form threatened to deter people from reading the actual novel and simply picking up the comic version. Indeed, skimming through the reviews thus far, many have either only seen the films, or are completely new and this is their introduction to the series. What a shame.Throughout reading the graphic novel, I wondered multiple times to myself, "How was this allowed to publish?" And the primary reason I wondered this was due to the very poor quality of writing. Denise Mina\'s characterization of Lisbeth Salander is entirely, well, out of character. Mina\'s Salander has a far more comfortable social life. She makes witty quips, smiles, even goes dancing at a club. Anyone who has read the books (or even if you\'ve only seen the films, Swedish or American) will understand how far off this portrayal is. Another egregious flaw is the actual adaptation. Of course, all adaptations, especially when converting mediums, will require some amount of condensing. This is particularly true with Larsson\'s books, as they are lengthy and very densely plotted. I thought the way the American film handle this condensing of plot was superb. Things that work in novels won\'t consistently translate onto the screen well. So I understand and fully embrace the necessity of condensing plot and story in adaptations. But in Mina\'s so called adaptation, I would say that what she has done is, not condense, but paraphrase. This adaptation reads like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo SparkNotes.Despite my extreme disappointment, I will still most likely purchase and read the next Book, and the next, and so on. But I would recommend people who are interested to devote the time to Larsson\'s brilliant trilogy, watch the films (Swedish and American), and steer clear of the graphic novel.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Good adaption of a great novel. It is extremely hard, I'd say impossible, to put Stieg Larsson's masterwork between only 146 pages. I liked the comic but it could not transmit all the feelings, the rawness, the cruelty and genius of the original work.\n         ", u'\n           \n           This book is perhaps the most pointless cash grab I\'ve ever read in my whole life. I will concede that some of the illustrations - especially the cover - were gorgeous and obviously had been done meticulously and lovingly. However:- This book is only HALF of a book I\'ve already read. It\'s incredibly overpriced and, for that, I would recommend it to absolutely nobody. Dude, nearly ten pounds for half of a book I\'ve already read? This "section" of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo introduces us to a couple of the Vangers, the mystery surrounding Harriet\'s disappearance, and the subplot of Bjurman\'s abuse of Lisbeth. It cuts off abruptly after that. This was so obviously done to pump more money mercilessly out of Lisbeth Salander fans, such as myself. What kind of publishing company who have respect for their readers would hack the (already extremely well known) plot of Dragon Tattoo in half and release them as two incredibly expensive separate graphic novels otherwise? - That\'s bad enough, but so much of the graphic novel is simply the book, rehashed. It seemed to me that when Mina didn\'t have the books to copy, she would return to either of the two films (mostly the Swedish version) to crib whole lines of translated dialogue. This also returns back to the question of overpricing and who in hell thought it was a good idea to cut the book in half. I understand that manga frequently takes more than one volume to tell a story, which is fine, because God knows The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has a lot of stuff in it. However, because Mina follows the structure of the films so religiously, it was deja vu all over again. The feeling of having "half a book" is compounded by the paper-thin and incredibly superficial storytelling over the half a book we already have!- Some of the drawings are gorgeous. I thought the artwork of the prologue was beautifully done, as was Lisbeth\'s rape by Bjurman. However, so much attention seemed to be lavished on Lisbeth - who, I will admit, did look different between panels but is also pretty much made for graphic novel format - that Mikael looked pathetic by comparison. I also liked the rendering of Henrik, but it seems if the artists aren\'t working with large, obvious shapes - such as the craggy, aged face of Henrik Vanger or Lisbeth\'s iconic appearance - they prevaricate into almost comic looking scribbles. It\'s hard to tell the Vangers apart - I thought Cecilia Vanger and Erika looked far too alike - and Mikael looked like a grownup Tintin. Harriet Vanger\'s face was so inexpressive that I was left with nothing but a feeling of deep disappointment. \n         ', u"\n           \n           Ok I've read the millennium trilogy, seen the Swedish versions of all three films including the extended cuts and the Hollywood version, so I was interested to see how the graphic novel adaptation was handled. Lisbeth Salander is probably one of the most intriguing heroines ever put down on paper, socially inept, a moody genius, hard as nails and prone to the odd spot of violence when threatened.The graphic novel relies heavily on the fact that the reader is intimately familiar with the storyline and would understand what is going on when confronted with page after page with little or no dialogue. A little more explanation of what is happening was required, if you've not already bought into the franchise and its your first experience of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo then this I'm afraid is not going to pull you in and leave you desperate for more.On to the artwork, which is where my main problem lies, Looking at the cover I thought I was in for a treat with the fantastic drawing of Lisbeth smoking a cigarette but the cover had the time spent on it, unfortunately the rest of the novel felt rushed and a little sloppy. There is one small panel where we see Lisbeths dragon tattoo in all its splendour and it looks fantastic but overall there is no consistency and she looks to different from page to page. Its almost like the artist has tried to combine the looks of Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara, some of it looks really good and some really bad. The same can be said of the artists rendering of Mikael Blomkvist almost as if the novel is aimed at the Hollywood versions audience with a blonde Adonis type figure.The sexual violence is a big talking point of the novel and films, the rape of Lisbeth Salander by her evil guardian Nils Bjurman is handled slightly differently in the graphic novel. Bjurman is a woman hating sadist who in the book makes a conscious decision to abuse someone in his care, yet here he is portrayed as a guy with mental problems who thinks Lisbeth is attracted to him. Can't really understand why this change in character profile from the source material was done, Bjurman is an evil man who has committed an atrocious act that deserved suitable punishment and now the whole concept is changed, it doesn't diminish the act but changes the perception. Lisbeth has her revenge in the same fashion but this change was not done well and was another negative aspect of the adaptation. There is obviously some great source material for this graphic novel and I thought it would be extremely difficult to f**k this up but I was left disappointed, even more so because I bought volume 2 and both of them are expensive but I will read to see if they destroy it any more.\n"], 0]!!!![u'33304238', u'\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0625\u064a\u0636\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0631', u' ', u'\n6980870\n\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6980870._\n4.44\n89\n5\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'-2', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'31556933', u'Schnitzen einer Fliege: Eine Schritt-f\xfcr-Schritt-Anleitung', u' ', u'\n14694581\nHermann Werst\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14694581.Hermann_Werst\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'32013921', u'The Standard Guide; Mackinac Island and Northern Lake Resorts', u'140', u'\n5158478\nAnonymous\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous\n4.15\n1077998\n56493\n', u'2016', u'8', u'29', u'Wentworth Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The Hawkwind crew are good in every way (even if a bit misunderstood by the "straights"). The evil Dark Lord is so bent on power that he seems to care nothing for the fact that he quite obviously will have to completely destroy the entire world to achieve his goals.What makes it interesting enough to read twice? The fact that it\'s about Hawkwind and deals with several of their most well-known band members. But beyond that, it barely qualifies as fan-fiction. You won\'t learn anything cool about the band Hawkwind by reading this book. A bit weird in places, so maybe at least the author tried to get in the spirit of Hawkwind and leave the audience spaced out.And that\'s another thing - do NOT be fooled that this is Moorcock\'s book.

"It is only as we submit our spiritual practices, religious rituals, and dogmatic affirmations to the flames of fearless interrogation that we come into contact with the reality that Christianity is in the business of transforming our world rather than offering a way of interpreting or escaping it.

Well worth the read. I agree that Bonhoeffer presents a more consummate vision of etsi deus non daretur (living as if there was no God) than Rollins, one that does not exclude the importance of worship and prayer in private, and loving God-as-object as much as God-as-action. However, I know Rollins is writing another book that he claims "deepens and develops" some of the themes brought up in this one, so I\'ll have to see where he takes things. ***Wow. This may be the most thorough and relentless breakdown of Christian psychology I\'ve ever read.Rollins\' central thesis is dead-on, for my money: the modern church has become a security blanket for people, a comfortable construct that shields us from the world and prevents us from facing the true nihilistic devastation that is at the heart of the Crucifixion: a loss of God, a loss of meaning, and a loss of hope. "Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani?" / "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34) \u2013 Rollins asserts that we have missed the profound implications of Christ\'s experience on the cross, of God being forsaken by God. Based on this assertion, he proceeds to systematically torch every lie Christians tell each other about God and about themselves: even the lies that feel so genuine when we\'re telling them. As he correctly points out, we are too often satisfied with the false God we\'ve created for ourselves \u2013 an image that makes us feel better, a deus ex machina that is always there when we need our problems fixed. We essentially ignore Christ, no matter how much we profess him. We don\'t truly process the fact that he experienced the same dark night of the soul and loss of God that all of us do at some point. We miss the point that God himself embraced doubt as a human being, both in Gethsemane and on the Cross \u2013 and until we do the same, we have not truly participated in Crucifixion and Resurrection with him, and we can never really experience change. Over and over again, the Scriptures tell us to die to ourselves in order to find ourselves, but most churches are structured to prevent us from doing this. They afford people no opportunity to face doubt \u2013\xa0the divine catalyst \u2013\xa0and therefore no opportunity to die to the comforts and masks that keep them afloat every day. Some communities do, of course, and those are the ones that contain world-changers. Because once you\'ve faced your own fears and misgivings and wrestled with them, there\'s really nothing left to hide behind. And that\'s when we can love fearlessly, holding nothing back. And that\'s where God is.Now, this has been my own takeaway. Did I agree with every word Rollins wrote? Certainly not. But I don\'t think he wants me to. As he points out toward the end, it\'s in the challenge and in the conflict itself that truth is unearthed and becomes visible \u2013 not in any pat answers or established systems. When the deus ex machina God of religion dies, Christ and the Resurrection remain, as confounding and unsafe as ever. There is so much to digest and think about in this slim little volume that I couldn\'t possibly summarize it all in a review. Suffice to say, if you ever read it, I would LOVE to discuss it with you.\n         ', u'\nInsurrection asks the reader to accept the challenge given by Bonhoeffer: to embrace a religionless Christianity, a Christianity without dogma, a Christianity wherein the philosophical question of God\'s existence is really not, existentially speaking, important at all, a Christianity which requires us to give up God in order to find God, a Christianity which offers no easy answers but forces us to ask hard questions and requires us to embrace the pain and the anxiety of our uncertain, strange existence.Insurrection is a child of Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, Bonhoeffer, and Tillich. Rollins envisions Christianity not as a religion but as an existential engagement with a world that presents us with death and meaninglessness. Christianity does not, for Rollins, function mythologically: it does not tell us from whence we came; it does not tell us where we are going; it does not show us how to find salvation in a world to come or even in this world; it does not comfort us as we face death and our own finitude.Rather, Christianity requires us to give up religion (for Rollins, this is Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane), to give up God (on the Cross), and to find God (in the Resurrection) not as an individual being or something but rather as an act: the act of love, loving the world and embracing it in the face of despair and meaninglessness.The insurrection that Rollins proclaims is rebellion against the power structures of the world: political, social, religious, etc. These structures hide reality from us and allow us to deceive ourselves into living lives that, while they may be comfortable, are not authentic, are not true to ourselves and our place in the world. And so if we want to live in truth, then we must give up our identities as defined by the cultural constructs which define our world: we are, following Paul, no longer male nor female, rich nor poor, Christian nor Muslim nor Hindu, American nor Ethiopian nor Arabic; instead, we are all one in Christ: we are all one in our anxiety and our uncertainty and our sadness but also in our joy and our happiness.Christianity in destroying our pseudo-identities allows to live authentically by loving our precarious situation in the world and working continually to be honest with ourselves about the nature of the world and trying to change the world, to rebel against all the structures that support and empower the evils of the world: poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia, political oppression, social discrimination, etc. In Christianity, we do not retreat from this world nor see ourselves as separate from it; rather, we recognize fully our position in this world yet engage it to change it through the power of God--that is, the power of love.Christianity helps us to see the world as it is and encourages to us change it. Christianity works to bring eternal life into the here and now. It is not concerned with what happens after death but is fervently interested in what happens before death. Christianity, for Rollins, ceases to be a religion. It is not a relationship with God. It is, instead, the place where God acts--that is, the place where love abounds.Insurrection sees Christianity as asking us to completely die to the self, to die to all the socially and culturally constructed identities that we have, to empty ourselves in the experience of the kenosis, to know the reality of a life without God that Christ knew when he cried out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Once we have seen what we are not and recognized that we have lost God on the Cross, then we can all see what are together and can work together and love one another. And it is here that the Insurrection becomes the Resurrection: we have destroyed the lie that comforts us, the lie that tells us who we are, the lie that promises that everything will end well, the lie that promises us answers; once these lies, these idols of the mind are destroyed, we can begin to live the life of Resurrection, the life of love--that is, the life of God--that transforms our world and destroys the powers of oppression and deception.The life of Resurrection, though, may not comfort us in the face of death and meaninglessness, but it does allow us to look honestly upon our finitude and embrace our sisters and brothers in love as we share our common world and work, even in the face of meaninglessness and death, to make a world of love.I\'ll end this review with one of my favorite passages from the book:"In the Incarnation, then, we find a fundamental transformation in the way that we are to approach God, a shift that takes us away from the religious understanding, which treats God as an object worthy of love, to a religionless understanding in which God is found in the very act of love itself . . . in the Incarnation, Crucifixion, and Resurrection we discover that God is not something we encounter directly and thus is not something that we experience. Rather, God is that which transforms how we experience everything, i.e., love. God is the name we give to the way of living in which we experience the world as worthy of living for, fighting for, and dying for.\u201d\n         ', u'\n           \n           Here\'s the thing: if you\'ve read a bunch of Zizek already, and thought about how it applies to the American church, a lot of this will feel very familiar. A lot of this feels like "Zizek for Churchies" or something.Here\'s the other thing: I\'m glad such a thing exists. It draws the lines connecting Zizek\'s thought to important conclusions about how the church can leave behind some of its most embarrassing and damaging current tendencies, and it does so in a way that has at least a fighting chance to not totally alienate people in the church.\n         ', u"\n           \n           I really hate this book. Insurrection cut me to the core - it caused me to experience nearly the full range of human emotions, physical manifestations and all. The doubt mentioned in the title is an understatement. Rollins managed to get me to a place of sheer existential dread, more than a few times. Think of it as the book equivalent of heavyweight champion-era Mike Tyson (I got knocked the F**K OUT). There are very few other works that I've thought through so deeply and processed to such a significant degree after reading. Despite the pain, I now realize that I needed this book, because above all else it's inspired me to live and love like never before.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I couldn\'t tear my eyes away from the book, but not necessarily in a good way. Honestly, this felt like an attempt to write something profound, but in the end much of it was "meaningless," a term Rollins would probably enjoy very much. It felt more or less like the blabbering of an undergraduate student in a Continental Philosophy class. Everything was very vague, undefined, and mystical. The whole point of the book is that doubt is preferable to a concrete set of beliefs, yet somehow that amounts to an affirmation of the Crucifixion and Resurrection.(?) Rollins is no doubt an intelligent man, but I\'m not sure what he was getting at with this book. A couple things I didn\'t get that maybe someone else will find:(1) He seems to despise organized religion. I\'m guessing this is what he means when he frequently refers to "fundamentalism." Although he never defined fundamentalism, I guess he pictured something evangelical, perhaps even charismatic? I wish he was more specific in his critique of what he meant by fundamentalism.(2) His arguments are somewhat weak and show him to be naive on basic principles of interpretation. For example, the argument that Jesus didn\'t quote Psalm 22 from the cross is because it is put in Jesus\' native Aramaic tongue instead of Hebrew. He says that in Jewish faith the Hebrew Scriptures were read, memorized, and recalled in the original language and not one\'s native tongue. Perhaps he would want to ask Paul why every OT verse quoted by him in the NT comes from the LXX rather than the Hebrew Bible. Even if Matthew was written in Aramaic (which is debatable) this has nothing to do with Hebrew, much less making a case against Jesus referring to the passage in Psalm 22. This, if anything, indicated that Rollins lacked a basic understanding of the post-Alexandrian Hellenism that largely flooded the Hebrew language of the Jews and replaced it with Greek. I wouldn\'t build my argument on that paragraph as Rollins seemed to do.(3) "Radical doubt, suffering, and the sense of divine forsakenness are central aspects of Christ\'s experience..." Is that really how Rollins interprets Jesus on the cross? When did Christ ever doubt the work on the cross? I just didn\'t get this. (4) Rollins never really defines his own theological stance. I\'m guessing he is an "a/theist"? This is a position he seems fond of, which looks like a shallow form of mysticism or a glorified form agnosticism. I may be way off, but I don\'t really know how to place him. (5) The book lost credibility as a serious theological work in this statement on page 174: "the truth is not located in one position or the other, neither is the truth some overarching whole that contains all the various conflicting ideas. The truth arises in the very conflict itself, the conflict that drives us onward." Attempting to squash any concrete perspective on truth doesn\'t carry much weight in serious theological work. If anything, this undermines his attempt to convince anyone that he is right. Just another interpretation to consider. There were a few saving points, especially his criticism of hypocrisy within the church. However, this largely made Rollins out to be another caricature of relativistic, postmodern theology. But if you don\'t agree with my position you are free to "doubt" me. After all, that\'s preferable...\n         '], 0]!!!![u'19723662', u"Jumpin' Jimminy-A World War II Baseball Saga: American Flyboys and Japanese Submariners Battle it Out in a Swedish World Series", u' ', u'\n702378\nRobert Skole\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/702378.Robert_Skole\n5.00\n2\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'22085121', u'La m\xe9thode de Zadig : La trace, le fossile, la preuve', u'323', u'\n1300528\nClaudine Cohen\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1300528.Claudine_Cohen\n3.92\n26\n3\n', u'2011', u'', u'', u'Editions du Seuil', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28626043', u'House of Commons Papers, Volume 7', u'566', u'\n790673\nHouse of Commons\nCreator\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1511950922p5/790673.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1511950922p2/790673.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/790673.House_of_Commons\n3.50\n6\n1\n', u'2015', u'11', u'7', u'Arkose Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The first was the rise of the confessional school of poets, associated especially with Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, and John Berryman: poets who attempted to make poems out of their lives, frankly using their most intimate real life experiences as subject matter. At the same time, poetry rather suddenly went from being something which ordinary people at least occasionally would read \u2013 many old enough will remember a time when the typical household had at least a few poetry books around, even if they were old chestnuts like The Oxford Book of English Verse, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and The Complete Poems of Keats and Shelley \u2013 to something which virtually no one except poets, critics, and a few college students paid any attention to. Both as cause and effect of this disregard, poets quickly moved into the ivory tower, with the great majority of persons claiming the title poet actually making their living as academics. This migration of poets to the academy was simultaneous with the creative writing movement, in which professors believed any student could be taught to be a poet by being inculcated with the movement\u2019s trinity of principles \u2013 \u201cFind Your Voice,\u201d \u201cShow, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d and \u201cWrite What You Know,\u201d and mastering a toolkit of specialized literary devices. One of the most pernicious effects of these developments was the evolution of confessional poetry into poetry as therapy. Those original confessionalists were fine poets, but their successors adopted the same frankness without the same talent, learning, or discipline. The idea seems to have been, \u201cHey, those people wrote with agonized honesty about the most intimate experiences of their own lives and the result was good poetry, so if I write with agonized honesty about the most intimate experiences of my own life, it will be good poetry, right?\u201d Today it\u2019s reached the point where the prevalent type of mainstream American poetry, almost the only one which is taken seriously any more, resembles a rambling transcript of what one might say to one\u2019s therapist. It\u2019s as if the only poetic persona now considered acceptable were that of St. Sebastian. And such deeply felt, courageously honest expression of course demands a moral exemption from criticism, literary or otherwise: this is my LIFE, this is my PAIN \u2013 how can you \u201cnot like it?\u201dIt\u2019s against this background that one needs to understand why Stag\u2019s Leap has been greeted with near universal admiration. On its appearance, it was praised in terms gushing even for our notoriously adulatory poetry critics. Reviews from major magazines and literary web sites have described it as \u201cmoving,\u201d \u201cinsightful,\u201d \u201cremarkable,\u201d and \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d Carol Ann Duffy, perhaps the most prominent current British poet, remarked on the \u201cgrace and gallantry\u201d of a \u201cworld-class poet.\u201d Stag\u2019s Leap immediately won the prestigious British T. S. Eliot poetry prize and now, more recently, the Pulitzer. The book is indeed the summation of the creative writing poetry which has come to dominate contemporary verse\u2013 so it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s a summary of everything which is wrong, false, and disappointing about American poetry today. It\u2019s a landmark in what has to be one of the dreariest, most uninspired, and least creative (surely there has never been a less creative literary movement than Creative Writing) periods of poetry in history. The clich\xe9 starts with the subject matter: family dysfunction, specifically divorce. This is certainly a legitimate subject for literature, but it\u2019s not a promising one \u2013 it\u2019s been done so many times lately that any book that wants to do it again should really do it differently than any other book has. This book doesn\u2019t. Clich\xe9 continues with the title, which like too many recent verse collections uses a coyly clever pun (Stag\u2019s Leap \u2013 the favorite wine of a couple \u2013 of whom the husband is the stag who \u201cleaps\u201d free by divorce \u2013 get it?) to place a friendly arm over the reader\u2019s shoulder: I\u2019m smart enough to make the pun, and you\u2019re smart enough to understand it, so off we go together!\u201dOpening the book, we find a series of poems each running, as most creative writing verse is supposed to, one or a little more than one standard poetry magazine page in length, divided, as so many creative writing poetry volumes nowadays are, into four or five high-level sections. On this solid basis of bromide is erected a superstructure of verse that chugs through a series of remarkably unappetizing vignettes of domestic discord. As we read on, we find that tired old creative writing workshop gimmicks are rife. For instance, the contemporary obsession with line breaks becomes almost maniacal in such passages as:Now I come to look at love in a new way, now that I know I\u2019m notstanding in its light. I want to ask myalmost-no-longer husband what it\u2019s like to notlove\u2026I find this sort of thing as distracting and irritating as the sort of person? who in talking? to you puts a rising inflection? every few syllables? so it sounds? like they are always asking you questions?As to the subject matter, the personal agonies of the speaker are, to be sure, presented with the painful honesty which is held nowadays to ensure poetic quality. I don\u2019t believe it ever does, but to say anything disapproving about such sincere disclosures of anguish would leave me open to the accusation of not being a warm, caring human being, a charge which I would find so woundingly hurtful that I feel I have no choice but passively to allow emotional honesty to fulfill its role of forestalling criticism, and be silent. About the style of this verse, however, I feel no such reticence. For a book so widely praised for its poetical accomplishment, the verse here at points actually seems startlingly sloppy, factually, stylistically, and even grammatically. For instance, grammatically: where what cannotbe seen is inferred by what the visibledoes \u2026This is simply bad English: you infer from; you imply by. The fact that these words are confused by many people doesn\u2019t make the confusion sound any less inept and vulgar in a supposedly serious piece of literature. Or, factually:Meanwhile the planetsorbited each other, the morning and the evening cameNo doubt the morning and the evening came, but we may be sure the planets did not orbit each other. Another standard creative writing gimmick used here, one seen regularly in recent academic poetry, is the sprinkling of deliberately obscure words: \u201cstallor, tomentose, surcingle, ligate, latchet, slub \u2026\u201d (this last, I\u2019m afraid, being a term more likely to be familiar, to youthful readers at least, in its currency as an internet slang insult than in its formal meaning of a thick spot in yarn.) Another usage I had to blink at was:\u2026 a flurryof tears like a wirra of knives \u2026Maybe there is more than one word wirra, but the only one I know is an old-fashioned Irish exclamation of woe which, while no doubt originally Irish, has for at least a century and a half been used in English almost exclusively in the popularized dialect of sentimental stereotyped Irish songs and novels, giving the word in English contexts an ineluctable connotation of \u201cstage Irish:\u201d to my ear, comparing tears to \u201ca wirra of knives\u201d sounds as bizarre as describing surprise as \u201ca begorrah of eyebrows.\u201d For some reason, though, several reviewers have quoted the phrase admiringly as an example of bold poetic creativity. Well, there\u2019s no accounting for tastes.There is of course nothing intrinsically wrong with a poet using an obscure word, but it\u2019s a matter of why. So far as I can see, in these poems this eccentric diction rarely adds vividness to the images or depth to the connotations. But if a poem is going to send most of its readers off to the dictionary, it had better have a good reason for doing so. The only reason I can see for doing so in books like this is showing off: \u201cSee I\u2019m a poet, so I\u2019m using the FULL RESOURCES OF THE LANGUAGE!\u201d (Professor, will these words be on the exam?)More evidence of shallowness of technique is provided by the throwaway allusions scattered throughout the book. Literary allusions are supposed to give depth and resonance to a present work by invoking the light of tradition to cast multiple shadows from it. But the allusions in these poems seemed to me, like the obscure words, usually just there for the sake of show, or, like the punning title, to give the reader a chance to feel clever. They take the most famous bits of great works (presumably on the assumption that those are the only bits today\'s readers will know or remember) and simply paste them into the verse, without much attention being paid to whether the allusions really resonate in their context. For instance, in "Material Ode" (page 7, also may be viewable in the amazon preview), we have two allusions to the famous beginning lines of Vergil\'s Aeneid, "of arms and the man I sing," and one to the most famous lines penned by a woman novelist, Jane Eyre\'s, "Reader, I married him." But these quotes have only a vague relation to the situation in the poem: all right, the poem, like The Aeneid, sings of a man, but that\'s as far as it goes (except for a rather inept pun on "arms" as an embrace), and the poem, like the Jane Eyre quote, is about a marriage, but that\'s as far as that goes.To give examples of how it could be done better, a poet who knew how to use allusion effectively could have brought in a different famous line from Vergil, copied later by Dante, "I recognize the tokens of the ancient flame," which would have connected the present situation with a classic story of an abandoned woman as well as setting up suggestions of working through a purgatorial emotional state, and maybe also ironically invoking an image of redemption through love. Or if such a poem wants to bring in a great woman novelist, the three syllables "badly done" would suggest to anyone familiar with Jane Austen\'s work a complex of reproach, regret, and emotional misstep which could resonate with the poem\'s situation. Such subtleties of allusion seem beyond this book. But given the current state of literacy in America, they would probably be beyond most of the book\'s audience too.As another example of careless technique, consider the lines from \u201cYears Later\u201d (p. 85):like the face of a creature looking outfrom inside its Knox\u2026The problem here is that this statement is likely to be incomprehensible to anyone who hears it rather than reads it: is the creature somehow inside \u201cknocks?\u201d or inside the Latin word for night, \u201cnox?\u201d Relying on the capital letter to clarify a meaning (which is presumably \u201cfortress\u201d) which wouldn\'t come across orally is technically careless. (Though as a matter of fact even with the capital letter the phrase is a little confusing: the first time I read it, I thought the creature was in a bowl of gelatin.) This may seem like a small point, but false notes in poetry are as egregious as they are in music, at least they are if the poetry is seriously trying to be any good.Should anyone object that my comments are harsh, my defense is to point out that the reputation of a book which has won the accolades mentioned above will hardly be impaired by the opinion of a nobody like myself. But though my opinion may not be significant, I, like everyone, have a right to it, and my opinion is that this is a bad book, and that the fact that it\u2019s been received as such a good one is shocking and discouraging evidence of the abysmal state to which the professors have reduced both our poetry and our taste.\n         ', u'\n           \n           An entire book of poems about a divorce after thirty years of marriage examines love and loss, age and youth, the body, what it is to be together and to be alone, and successfully capturing the most beautiful, subtle moments of realization. I\'ve never seen the subject of marriage examined with such quiet honesty. It reminded me of Ted Hughes\' Birthday Letters, about Plath--though this is nowhere near as tragic, and Anne Carson\'s The Beauty of the Husband, especially in the descriptions of the husband physically. But this collection is about divorce reflected in the eye of Sharon Olds, reflecting her particular temperament, which happens to be loving, generous and fair. In reading the book, I imagined many times what Plath would have said here, if she had been the one left, or what Sexton would have said. Plath was such a good hater, and Sexton could be so cruel. None of that here. The first poems are the first inkling, the first admissions, when it still might be otherwise. Then the dawning that it was going to be real. How to tell her ancient mother. How to tell her own body that he is gone--this is one of my favorites of the collection, "Poem for the Breasts":"...All year they have been calling to my departed husband,singing to him, like a pair of soakingsirens on a scaled rock.They can\'t believe he\'s left them, it\'s not in theirvocabulary, they being madeof promise..."Every subtle but horrible moment, like giving him back his things, things she\'s lived with for three decades, in "Object Loss":",,,I had not knownhow connected I\'d felt, through him, to a world ofhanded-down, signed, dated, appraised things, pedigreed matter...I feel as if I\'m falling awayfrom family--as if each ponderousobject had been keeping me afloat. No, they werethe scenery of the play now closing..."Although the Plath in me wanted her to sweetly dump his stuff in the pool, or sell it at a yard sale for $1, or burn it on the girlfriend\'s lawn. But it wouldn\'t be Olds, who is far too grownup for tantrums.What she does capture are the bizarre corners of divorce--how she wants to comfort him for the pain he\'s feeling for leaving her in "Last Look""all that day until then, I had beencomforting him, for the shock he was inat his pain--the last of leaving metook him back, to his own early losses. But now it was time to go beyondcomfort, to part..."and then there\'s "Not Going To Him" that insane but human way we want to be comforted by the very person who delivered us the blow, because he is the one we are closest to--very like breaking an addiction:"Minute by minute, I do not get up and just go to him...It is what I do now: not go, notsee or touch..."the book is divided up into sections--the first parting (January-December), the first aloneness (winter), then Spring, Summer, Fall and Years Later. She moves ahead and falls back, as each aspect is examined, the personal and the universal. Here is the moment she finds a picture of the other woman in the washing machine, and here the moment where she wishes he had just died, that that would be easier. Wonderful erotic detail informs us there was a reason she was so besotted of this man, and what to do with her eroticism now that he is gone--I loved that in a poem called "French Bra"--just the description is like touch:"... like a hermes heel-wing,fitted with struts and ailerons,fragile as a silk biplane, the soutien-gorge lies, lissome, unguarded..."Memories of a miscarriage they\'d had, memories of a summer rental home, and then, years later--coming across him at an art opening in "Running into You": "... But you seemedcovered with her, like a child working with gluewho\'s young to be working with glue...When I went up to you two, at the art opening,I felt I had nothing to apologize for,I felt like a somewhat buoyant creaturewith feet of I don\'t know what, recovered-from sorrow..."The issue she comes back to is how she had not really known how he felt, that she had made assumptions about him, that the betrayal was not just his. A beautiful multifaceted collection equal to its subject. "\n         ', u"\n           \n           I'm not a poet, and I admit that there were some poems here that were hard to understand. But I felt the Sharon Olds' pain and grief. And that's what matters to me: that the poet was able to channel her emotions to me, the reader. That she was able to relate to me the ruthless beauty of what she was going through.\n         ", u'\n           \n           The title of Sharon Olds\u2019 poetry collection detailing her painful, unwanted divorce is the perfect metaphor, and yet that wasn\u2019t clear to me until I read the note in the book. Stags Leap is the favorite wine of Olds and her former husband. By adding the apostrophe, Olds gives us an incredible metaphor for a man leaving his wife. She was able to use the official logo from the winery, that of a single stag leaping, perhaps throwing himself, off a cliff. \tThen the drawing on the label of our favorite red wine\tlooks like my husband, casting himself off a\tcliff in his fervor to get free of me.\t(Stag\u2019s Leap)This book is clearly confessional poetry, and Olds finally claims the genre. In an interview in the Huffington Post, she says, after years of avoiding the label, \u201cWhat\'s so bad about admitting I don\'t make anything up? So I started admitting that. Now I am happy to talk about how, for me, unlike most poets, the imagination is not very active." http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/...Olds makes good use of metaphor and simile in her details of a long marriage falling apart. She is honest in sharing that the lust and love one feels doesn\u2019t disappear instantly. \t\tMy body may never learn\tnot to yearn for that one,\t(Not Going to Him)\tI tell him I will try to fall out of\tlove with him, but I feel I will love him\tall my life.\t(The Flurry)The ways Olds refers to her husband throughout the collection signify the emotional transitions since he left. In the early poems, she calls him her husband, then her \u201calmost-no-longer husband\u201d (Unspeakable), then moves to \u201cmy then husband\u201d (The Healers), which implies there is still a connection. She finally uses the blunt term \u201cmy ex\u201d. These terms are not entirely chronological, however, which gives the reader insight into the complexity of the fact that while the marriage may dissolve legally in a linear progression, the emotional dissolution is more roundabout.There is agony in the second guessing, the wondering why his love ended.\t\t\t\tThen I\tfelt in my whole body, for a second,\tthat I have not loved enough\t(Telling My Mother)\tDread and sorrow reaching, in time, into\tevery reach, there comes the hour\tI wonder if my husband left me\tbecause I was not quiet enough\tin our bed.\t(Not Quiet Enough)Olds is able to look at the marriage and acknowledge that perhaps she really didn\u2019t know this man.\t\tBut from within my illusion of him\tI could not see him, or know him.\t(Frontis Nulla Fides)While there is plenty of angst over being left, rarely do we see anger. Even her writing is measured, polite, and considerate of how he must have been feeling. \t\tI think he had come, in private, to\tfeel he was dying, with me,\t(Pain I Did Not)Eventually, in the section captioned \u201cYears Later\u201d, Olds says\tAnd slowly he starts to seem more far\taway, he seems to waft, drift\t(Slowly He Starts)In the final poem, \u201cWhat Left?\u201d, Olds admits that within the marriage \u201cWe fulfilled something in each other.\u201d Rather than ending with being left, the poem concludes with the line \u201cI freed him, he freed me.\u201d\n', u'\n           \n           My middling rating is for the collection as a whole, while individual poems I would rank more highly if I could. The series of poems were written during and after the poet\'s husband divorced her for another woman after thirty or so years of marriage. Oh, her! They are deeply personal, confessional in style, and sometimes embarrassing to read (for me). There was something about reading them that felt too much like looking through another woman\'s bedside drawer. The repetition of the theme - the loss of this one man - was a bit unpleasant for an entire volume. Still, there were moments of beautiful detail and description of ordinary things. In "On Reading a Newspaper for the First Time as an Adult," Olds\'s description of the handling of paper pages is exactly right: "I am / letting fall what I have read, / and creasing what\'s left lengthwise, the crackly / rustle [. . . ] / that sitting waltz with the paper, / undressing its layers, blowsing it, / opening and closing its delicate bellows, / folding till only a single column is un- / taken in." Even smaller details brought joy to the reading. In another poem, "September 2001, New York City," she recalls signing her divorce papers and coming "down to the / ground floor of the Chrysler Building, / the intact beauty of its lobby around us / like a king\'s tomb, on the ceiling the little / painted plane, in the mural, flying." The poem is a rich meditation on life and death, but once again I wished that her husband wasn\'t in it. I just got tired of the guy. Despite the occasional jarring note and the soon-to-be-ex-husband / now-ex-husband motif, I enjoyed most of the work. It would be hard to live through the pain of losing a long-standing marriage so suddenly or losing the man you have loved for so many years to another woman who did not have his children, did not have the shared past with him that you did. \n'], 0]!!!![u'19378311', u'Sternstunden der Menschheit.

Spre exemplu, Cucerirea Bizan\u0163ului ("Mahomed \u015fi Constantin \u015ftiu am\xe2ndoi c\u0103 ziua aceasta hot\u0103r\u0103\u015fte pentru secole \u015fi secole de istorie"). De\u015fi din legendarul Imperiu Bizantin nu mai r\u0103m\u0103sese dec\xe2t capitala, Constantinopolul, puternic fortificat -aproape de nep\u0103truns-, 8000 de solda\u0163i \u0163in piept unei o\u015ftiri otomane ce num\u0103r\u0103 150.000 de oameni. Otomanii au de trecut de zidurile cet\u0103\u0163ii -probabil cel mai puternic adversar al lor. Istoria, care adesea joac\u0103 pe degete destinul, face ca, \xeentr-o zi din cadrul b\u0103t\u0103liei, una dintre por\u0163ile din al doilea zid al cet\u0103\u0163ii (fiind trei, dar cel de-al treilea, deci cel de la exterior, fusese spart) s\u0103 fie uitat\u0103 deschis\u0103. "KERKAPORTA" a r\u0103mas \xeen istorie un simbol. Desigur, ne \xeendoim cu to\u0163ii de rezisten\u0163a de care ar mai fi putut da dovad\u0103 oamenii lui Constantin, \xeen schimb, aceast\u0103 vulnerabilitate, aceast\u0103 palm\u0103 a destinului, Kerkaporta, a prilejuit intrarea grabnic\u0103 a otomanilor pe poart\u0103 cre\u015ftin\u0103t\u0103\u0163ii.

Cum ar fi ast\u0103zi lumea f\u0103r\u0103 c\xe2teva secole de domina\u0163ie otoman\u0103?! Un alt episod definitoriu al istoriei este B\u0103t\u0103lia de la Waterloo (iunie 1815). Zweig o roman\u0163eaz\u0103 foarte mult (dar f\u0103r\u0103 a dep\u0103\u015fi hotarele istoriei). Titlul miniaturii este, de asemenea, hiperbolic -"MINUTUL LUMII LA WATERLOO".

Al principio pens\xe9 que su estilo era demasiado recargado y rimbombante, ya no se escribe as\xed, pero poco a poco, con un entusiasmo y una capacidad para la \xe9pica poco com\xfan, me fui sumergiendo en las vidas que el autor nos trae hasta sumergirme por completo y que ese arcaico tono que impera en sus p\xe1rrafos no importara lo m\xe1s m\xednimo.Un libro que aporta conocimiento desde una perspectiva humana, que habla de valores m\xe1s que de acontecimientos hist\xf3ricos. Obra muy recomendable para saber y sentir la historia.El pasaje de Scott en su carrera contra Amundsen para conquistar el Polo Sur es simplemente hipnotizante.\n         ', u'\n\u0646\u0645\u0631\u0647 \u06cc \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u06cc: \u062f\u0648 \u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0645 -

Before he was five years old, Cody experienced physical, verbal and sexual abuse. He would witness his mother's sexual immorality and drug abuse, and then she would be removed from his life. Her choices would adversely affect his young life and would send him into a pattern of fear, hopelessness, rebellion, and rage that would take him into a world of darkness he could not escape. His behavior was easily interpreted as malicious and devious, but those were just symptoms of a wounded spirit, a crushed heart, and a lonely little boy who desperately longed to be loved, but was terrified to be loved.

The ancient manners, the habits and customs of the aboriginal race by whom the Highlands of Scotland were inhabited, had always appeared to me peculiarly adapted to poetry. The change in their manners, too, had taken place almost within my own time, or at least I had learned many particulars concerning the ancient state of the Highlands from the old men of the last generation. I had always thought the old Scottish Gael highly adapted for poetical composition. The feuds and political dissensions which, half a century earlier, would have rendered the richer and wealthier part of the kingdom indisposed to countenance a poem, the scene of which was laid in the Highlands, were now sunk in the generous compassion which the English, more than any other nation, feel for the misfortunes of an honourable foe." This edition is a reprint of a version published in 1883. It has been attractively formatted to allow for easy reading.', u'3980', u'3.85', u'1068', [(u'to-read', 2596), (u'poetry', 72), (u'classics', 70)], [u"\n           \n           The only thing i read on my Romantic Literature MA that i gave a crap about. If you want Romantic poetry that defies Wordsworth, and his ever-so-tedious ilk, then this is the guy. Rock on Scotland, the progenitor of pissing people off. This poem is written with extensive notes; it is PIVOTAL that the poem is read in conjunction with these. All the peri-textual material, the introduction, the notes are as much the beating heart of the poem as the Cantos. They display a measure of detail, both real, and fake that really produce the truth of this poems agenda - what is history? Is it a song? Is it folk law? Is it the enduring landscape, which bears the scars of former generations? Is it all of the above? Is it none of the above? Scott uses all his power as an atiquarian to historicize Scotland's National Identity in this poem. So much so that, on its publication, it became the premier Victorian vacation spot. Literary Tourism at its biggest and baddest. Like most of Scott, it is now plunged into the depths of obscurity. I should never have come accross it unless i did my post grad course. So much of fiction is so easily forgotten, but at one point, this was the most printed book in the world. Probably why you can find editions of Scott's poetry in second hand book shops in such numbers. Not everyone has the ability to endure like Austen, or Shakespeare. Scott deserves more focus. He is a dude. This poem is an exercise in creative innovation. A vision of the past to define the future. The great thing is - he suceeded. A great neo-medievalist text. He held the baton high. Go on there Scotty-boy!\n         ", u"\n           \n           This is a beautiful romantic poem in the midst of the rivalry of James the fifth and the Clan of Douglas in Scottland. It was originally printed in 1810. In this version there are explanitary notes and a wonderful introduction which explains the times in which this was written to better understand the poem.I recommend all of Walter Scott's books but especially this one.Enjoy and Be Blessed.Diamond\n         ", u'\n           \n           I found the copy of this book that I have under a floor board in our barn. The copyright is 1882 and there are notes written all through it in an old-style cursive from a student that was apparently studying the book at school. I love the description .. each seperate sonnet or poem takes you to new surroundings, and when I\'m not pre-occupied with other thoughts while reading these, I find myself feeling the emotions described. I read this to my children at bed time to calm them down. Here;s a sample from Canto 1; the setting is in the vicinity of Loch Katrine, in the Western Highlands of Perthshire.The Lady of the LakeCanto 1XXXV.The wild rose, eglantine, and broomWasted around their rich perfume;The birch-trees wept in fragrant balm;The aspens slept beneath the calm;The silver light, with quivering glance,Played on the water\'s still expanse,-Wild were the heart whose passion\'s swayCould rage beneath the sober ray!He felt its calm, that warrior guest,While thus he communed with his breast:\'Why is it, at each turn I traceSome memory of that exiled race"Can I not mountain maiden spy,But she must bear the Douglas eye?Can I not view a Highland brand,But it must match the Douglas hand?Can I not frame a fevered dream,But still the Douglas is the theme?I\'ll dream no more, by manly mindNot even in sleep is will resigned.My midnight orisons said o\'er,I\'ll turn to rest, and dream no more.\'His midnight orisons he told,A prayer with every bead of gold,Consigned to heaven his cares and woes,And sunk in undisturbed repose,Until the heath-cock shrilly crew,And morning dawned on Benbenue.I also love the battle scenes that give such description that I feel my heart beat fast and my hands sweat like I am being hunted. \n         ', u'\n           \n           The Lady of the Lake is a narrative poem set in the Trossachs region of Scotland. There are three main plots going at once: the constant war between the high and lowland Scots (the "Gaels" and "Saxons"), a battle between three men to win the heart of the young and alluring Ellen Douglas, and the feud and eventual rapprochement that occurs between James V (cunningly disguised and going by the alias James Fitz-James) and James Douglas. This is the first of Scott\'s work I\'ve read and I\'m already a huge fan. The Lady of the Lake is beautiful. Scott\'s emotive description is so eloquently written; he truly captures the Highlands in all its beauty. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this poem and look forward to more of Scott\'s work.

It is as though family therapy teachers were preoccupied with the content of what should be taught, and were not able to direct their attention to the process by which people learned.The authors began by describing the way they conceptualize the "learning context" which sets the frame for all the teaching they do. Then they discuss the process of setting up a family therapy course, e.g. "What is the best way to negotiate with a training officer to set up a course in a local area?." The book then moves to creating the course syllabus, and some of the practical problems-from lateness to mechanical failures-of getting the course off the ground.The family therapy courses being described are generic courses which cover all the major schools of thought from Structuralist to Strategic to systemic to Constructivist approaches. The unique contribution of this book is the many carefully crafted exercises which form the heart of the teaching/learning experience. Each exercise is designed to teach particular content, such as "enactment," or "circular questioning," which is related to a particular family therapy approach, yet the exercise is also designed with the learning context in mind and it pays attention to the ongoing relationship between teacher and student to maximize the learning which can take place.', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'13696639', u'The Passover Story Big Book', u'24', u'\n6062\nAnita Ganeri\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1311370591p5/6062.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1311370591p2/6062.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6062.Anita_Ganeri\n3.83\n3485\n442\n', u'2004', u'1', u'1', u'Evans Brothers', u'Watercolour illustrations breathe warmth and life into the story that lies behind the Jewish festival of Passover.

I was a little too irritated and I realize that without reading the full book, leaving a rating and review is already less than ideal. Still, for the sake of other like minded readers, I wanted to say something. I was hesitant to try just because of the description of her being older and he being a student. Let me say that is NOT the problem here. She\'s not technically older than him as he is an immortal. So if that\'s your only reservation-no worries on that score. PRO\'s:This cover is lovely.The physical description of the "hero" is fairly appealing.The heroine is described as having relaxed hair. For me, this is a pro just because everyone seems obsessed with natural or some UNnatural version of black hair re: flowing tresses. Relaxed is actually refreshing to me at this point.That\'s it.CON\'s:The things that happen within the first chapter of this book make absolutely ZERO fucking sense. I\'ll start by saying this author is obviously a Twilight fan. I saw enough similarities to see the spin she took (ageless hero attending high school who is unnaturally beautiful as are his sister and various other relatives that attend said school). If she\'s not a Twi-hard, I apologize but stand by my thought that the similarities are there. Glaringly so.We have a young teacher, recently graduated from college (22 I think). All in the span of her FIRST DAY on the job, she is more or less TOLD by the hero/ie her presumably 18 year old high school STUDENT that she has no choice but to tolerate and accept his advances. Now, that\'s off enough right? No, evidently not because next we have a coworker advising her not to make waves by objecting to said student\'s advances AND THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL flat out telling her if the boy wants to have an affair with her, she best shut up and do it if she values her career. Say wha? I mean, I KNOW we\'re all supposed to be intrigued by the obvious fear he engenders in everyone. Still, there is no inner dialog about how RIDICULOUS people are behaving, no mention by the heroine of how inappropriate it is that she is being advised to do this. She goes home....AND THINKS ABOUT IT! Next day we have her telling this boy, her supposedly 18 year old STUDENT that if they are going to do this its going to be on her terms and there are rules! I shit you not folks, within 24 hours she makes a conscious decision to sleep with a student. Day two of a teaching career. His response? Boy basically grabs her, tells her her rules mean nothing to him and they will all be broken. That\'s that. That\'s when I pulled the plug. It was too much. Bad enough they have this supposedly giant, gorgeous Russian (yes, she checked off all the current IR hottie boxes to create this guy)strutting around with his family entourage through a prep school. How cool or powerful CAN you even be IN HIGH SCHOOL to an adult woman??\n         ', u"\nNot Good, At All! This book made no sense whatsoever! Trying so hard to be like other stories. Glad it's over!

He\'d escaped his stifling family and returned to "where music had been invented," determined to discover the secrets of composition. "I\'d lived my whole life looking for rules."

He befriends prostitutes, hashish dealers, and ten year old conservatory students, eventually working his way up to playing with jazz greats like Django Reinhardt and Don Byas.

At sixty-six books, nearly 800,000 words, and numerous kings, prophets, and deliverers, as well as priests and apostles, where should you begin? In what order should you read it? Why are there narratives here and over there, but other things mixed between? And is there an alternative to reading the Bible from Genesis to Revelation? <br /><br />In A Reader\u2019s Guide to the Bible John Goldingay places the biblical books in their times and settings, and then lays out a memorable pattern for understanding the Bible. Three categories of biblical books\u2014story, word, and response\u2014form three doors into the cathedral that is the Bible: the story of God and his people, the word of God to his people, and the people\u2019s response to God.<br /><br />Whether you are a person of Christian faith or other faith, or no faith at all, here is a reliable guide to exploring the Bible. Written by a highly accomplished biblical scholar, A Reader\u2019s Guide to the Bible joins a clear and direct style with a maestro\u2019s touch.', u'7', u'5.00', u'1', [], [u'\n           \n           Over the years I have observed that many Christians struggle with reading the Bible. When we have talked it becomes clear that the majority of them have difficulty connecting the dots: fathoming how it all fits together and why. John Goldingay, the David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary, has just provided a comfortably readable aid for interested Christians in his brand-spanking-new "A Reader\'s Guide to the Bible." This 192 softback easily tackles the big picture of Scriptures\' trajectory, and the overall emphasis of the different genres in the Bible. It is written for interested students of Scripture, whatever stage of their faith-walk they may be in."A Reader\'s Guide to the Bible" begins by covering the historical and political events surrounding the Scriptures from the creation account through the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles to the time of Jesus and just beyond. Next, the author sketches out the geographical details where most of the biblical story unfolds. Though the material may appear elementary for more seasoned disciples, nevertheless newer readers will likely have some "Aha!" moments that will enable them to grasp the "why" and "wherefore" of certain episodes in Scripture.The remainder of the book covers the sixty-six books of Scripture simply and helpfully. Here Goldingay lumps together the sacred writings in a way that gives the learner a solid sense of how the story of God and his people flows together. The author addresses themes, styles, purposes and goals of the various books of the Bible, and how they fit together. Yet even more importantly, the author keeps the main point the main point; "The writers imply that their story is basically historical, but they invite us to respond to it as it stands as a story, to see what it means and what it has to say" (34-5).The final chapter is a delightful and essential conclusion to the whole volume. Goldingay explains the significance and value of the Old Testament for Christians, and its deep-rooted connection to the New Testament. The author basically takes on N.T. Wright\'s position of the five-act play, where each act is significant, makes the story as a whole, and finds it\'s climax in one of the latter acts; "the Old Testament leads to the New and hints at what becomes explicit there" (180)."A Reader\'s Guide to the Bible" is a very useful manuscript. I wasn\'t always satisfied with some of the author\'s assertions (i.e. multiple authors of "Isaiah," the date of Daniel\'s writing, etc.), nonetheless it is a masterful tool that is well written and brilliantly simple. This book would be perfect for a high school and adult Christian Education class in a congregation; as well as an "Introduction to the Bible" college course. Also, if a person is looking for a personal resource that will bring some clarity to their reading of Scripture, then they will find this to be just the volume the need. I happily and highly recommend this book.Thanks to IVP Academic for providing, upon my request, the free copy of the book used for this review.

Fantasy novel set in a mid-late eighteenth century AU with humans and nonhuman species. The setting is a blend of burgeoning technology with trains and airships and nobility, a Gilded Age in an altered landscape. The world building is convincing, including the more fantastical elements. Acting as valet, August provides more than the average attendant. Accompanying his lord to finalize his marriage to Queen Maeve, ruler of Umbra, their relationship is strained as Laurence gives up his holdings to become Prince Consort. Told from August's perspective, the change is both intriguing and unsettling as he attempts to navigate his way in the new waters of the capital, the household, and his lord's new bedchamber. If reserved, stilted affairs conducted circumspectly turns your crank then this is good choice. Laurence, as a duke, is the epitome of a stiff upper lip and August is fastidiously self-effacing. August's masochism and how the two exploit that is extremely satisfying if mild. He serves Laurence completely and thoroughly. It covers a lot of ground for a novella and explores issues of polyamory containing sensual and explicit scenes. At first, I was vaguely uncomfortable with some of the actions of characters without discussions, the resolution worked out well, but there were a couple instances of breach of trust and loyalty that tweaked me more than the characters. Admittedly, one was called out as such and the other turned out to be a non-issue. Let's just say that in these instances I find communication even more critical, but it provided tension for the plot. This is a strong 3.5 stars read for me, I could rate this 3 or 4 stars. I really like the elements here, but due to communication disconnect I'm rounding down--that is a me preference that really reflects my view on conducting polyamorous relationships.

Immediately upon being introduced to the character of August and the world he lives in, I was fascinated. August is sweet and unassuming and incredibly well written. We're first introduced to him as he's on a ride with his Lord Laurence and their entourage from Braxis into the Queen Maeve's palace in Umbra. The whole narrative of this short novella is that of a political marriage between Lord Laurence and Queen Maeve. The trick of it is, of course, that the story is told by August--the outsider to this marriage--who is quietly in love with Laurence. However, as his valet, any continuing affection or regard between them is assumed by him to be ended upon their arrival in Umbra. However, in many ways this story comes across as almost a teaser for a possibly longer story set within this world. A rich world is described in the journey across the Great Crater from Braxis to Umbra. I spent a lot of time wondering at the political structures of the world and the specific parts of it that Maeve and Laurence came from that would make a marriage between them so profitable. Are there patches of unrest? The smartest move by far in this book, I felt, was the decision to describe and also create a new word for the kinds of creatures that Laurence and Maeve are, as separate from the humans in the book. Very much like vampires, this race is also described to have long, pointed ears, have largely hairless bodies and go by the race name of 'vareld'. This also made me desirous of more knowledge into the world, what humans who weren't in the service of the vareld thought of this more powerful race. We get tastes of it in the texts, but I wanted more.Just like August, Maeve was a character I liked immediately upon her introduction on the page. From her descriptions, I could vividly imagine both her public and private personas. She's gentle and shy and quiet at times and assertive and strong in others. These qualities gave me the impression that she would be a great ruler without ever actually seeing evidence to that effect in the book. Laurence, on the other hand, was the only one of the three main characters who I thought could have used some fleshing out. I would have liked to have more insight into his character given how character driven, rather than plot driven, this story is. The interactions between he and August seemed flat and just sought for their sexual gratification. We got a lot of insight into August's feelings towards Laurence, but almost no feeling coming back from Laurence towards either August or Maeve. Special mention goes to the character of Vera for asexual representation, especially being present in a book with a polyamorous triad. I also really liked the presence of the character known only as The Voice, and the fact that it honestly didn't matter or change the gravity of their position regardless of what gender they were.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Lore Graham\'s worlds are complex and interesting, and I love the way the world-building is threaded into the plot seamlessly. I enjoyed discovering August\'s culture and surroundings as the story unfolded.For the most part, I enjoyed this story. The characters and setting are interesting. Although I wanted to know more about their society, there was enough detail to keep my attention, and I didn\'t feel as though it were lacking. It\'s more that I want to see other stories set in this realm.I liked August very much, but I\'m not entirely sure how I feel about his relationship with Laurence or with Maeve for that matter. I am still on the fence about the power imbalance. I don\'t really think August is being used, exactly, but he certainly isn\'t on the same level with the others. It particularly bothered me that August seemed more like he was servicing Laurence than that Laurence actually cared about him as a person, and that bothered me a bit. I was left with the impression of "we trust you and we will occasionally have you in our bed, but you\'re basically still a servant and should know your rightful place." It may just be a case of it not really being my thing.Other than that, though, it was very well written. There were some nicely steamy moments, and I definitely appreciated the skill regarding the creation of this world. I hope to see more about it in the future.I received a free copy via Inked Rainbow in exchange for an honest review.\n         ', u"\nAlthough I did enjoy this quick read, I was left feeling as if there could have been much more to this story.August in my opinion really does get the short end of the stick in this book. He works for Laurence basically as his personal assistant to whatever he needs and he is his secret lover also but I feel as if he is being used and nothing more. Then you throw Mauve (Laurence's soon to be new wife) into the mix and I feel as if both Laurence and Mauve are both getting their cake and eating it too.I believe that August is in love with Laurence and would never deny him any of his wishes but what I did not like about the story is Laurence never really said how he felt about August one way or the other and also Laurence is rather gold to August for the most part throughout the book.What I did enjoy about the book is the fact that Mauve was a very bright woman and treated August with respect even though she really did not have too. I think that she actually has feelings for both men. The fact that she wants to include instead of exclude August in their wedding night was more then August could have ever asked for. Not to mention she did not want him to leave when they were done.I enjoyed this story but I really wish that Laurence's character would have been more forth coming with his feelings and I wish that he would have made it clear what he really wanted from both Mauve and August.Was given this book for free by inked rainbow reads for an honest review\n         "], 0]!!!![u'11112148', u'Chemistry: Reactions', u' ', u'\n23957\nGlobe Fearon\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23957.Globe_Fearon\n3.75\n117\n15\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'3', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'16172198', u'Cat&apos;s Eye, Vol. 8', u'192', u'\n504087\nTsukasa Hojo\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1353926717p5/504087.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1353926717p2/504087.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/504087.Tsukasa_Hojo\n4.10\n5026\n83\n', u'1999', u'11', u'', u'Star Comics', u"Tre sorelle - Ai, Hitomi e Rui - gestiscono con profitto un delizioso e ben avviato caff\xe8.

MC Marcus O'Malley was very easy for me to relate to. . .we share a lot of similar qualities, For him it is being a guardian for his family, and for me it is being a big sister and mother hen. I found myself relating very much to his struggle and I thought the spiritual wrestling that he and the other MC did in this book very helpful and relatable. I also related to his deep heart. . . he feels things deeply, which is something I do as well. Plus, you just gotta love his banter. The other MC, Shari, was a little on the bland side, but she became loveable as time went on. I just didn't jive with her the way I do other characters. The mystery was compelling, and equally balanced with moments of normalcy. This book is filled with sweetness between all of the O'Malley characters, enjoyable characterization and a high stakes mystery and suspense.Reccomended for ages 16+Contains (view spoiler)[violence, description of crime scenes, blood, deaths, and means of murder.

The things I like most about the books are the romance aspect, but more importantly, the fact that each of the siblings has a different issue about God to deal with and I find that Dee Henderson makes the issues real - I can definately relate to a number of the themes and have enjoyed all the books. The ability to make people aware of aspects which might be affecting their relationship with God as well as the solution and the reasoning for making the choice I feel is a necessary one which makes us, the reader, think.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Augh!

But the way she handled it, the way she leaned on God through it all was just so good. And of course her and Marcus just had the sweetest relationship ever!!And the sibling relationships!

Sherri wasn\u2019t relatable at all, and the O\u2019Malley\u2019s fell in love with her by talking to her on the phone like twice? The beginning was good, good enough that it kept me reading, hoping that it would get good again. I don\u2019t think it did. The ending was a HUGE let down. So much so, that I have the next 2 books in this series and debating on reading them. I normally like Ms. Henderson\u2019s writing. Enough complaining, but be warned, may be a waste of your time as well. I am being generous by giving it a 2.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I really enjoyed this one!

An earlier review does an excellent job of reviewing the stories individually, and I'd have to say my personal favorite was Whyte Yot\xe9's. That said, this is a worthwhile read in every respect. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 solely because the artwork is inconsistent.\n         ", u'\n           \n           "Will of the Alpha" is a collection of furry short stories (with two poetic interludes) focused around BDSM. The stories are arranged in increasing order of intensity: the first stories are almost vanilla in their approach, but the last few pull no punches with their whips and chains.Two questions deserve to be answered right off the back: Is this collection a worth-while buy for readers interested in furry BDSM? And is it still a worth-while buy for readers with minimal interest in BDSM?To the first question, the answer is a very strong yes. Will of the Alpha includes a large variety of kinks, positions, and even orientations. (The stories prefer gay relationships over straight ones, although just barely. Two stories feature a bisexual male with both genders, and one story features a lesbian couple) All the stories in this collection have been edited to a fine polish; there is hardly an out-of-place scene or sentence left in the entire collection, and the result is a high-quality book that fully delivers on the promise of kinky, furry literature. I cannot think off-hand of another book focused on stories of furry BDSM currently in print: editors Rechan and Kandrel could have lazily published whatever they could drag together to pique the curiosity of the more leathery side of furry culture, but it\'s clear that they, and the authors, were determined to put their best foot forward and present a fine product.To the second question, the answer is far more dependent on the reader. If a prospective buyer thinks they might be turned off by anything more serious than the leashes and muzzles presented on the cover, then clearly this is not the book for them. If a prospective buyer has no particular interest in BDSM, but doesn\'t mind it\'s presence either, then they may find some unexpected treats in Will of the Alpha; some of the stories do read like straight-up BDSM smut, but a host of others use BDSM to explore interesting new characters, plots, and settings and could easily be enjoyed by this buyer.This slight inconsistency in thematic tone is the only major fault I can find in "Will of the Alpha," and it does not begin to make me reconsider my purchase. Like the traditional erotica story arc of "Boy meets girl. Boy fucks girl. The end." some stories in Will of the Alpha follow the story arc of "Sub meets dom. Sub gets fucked by dom. The end." That\'s ok every now and then, but it occurs just a little bit more than I would have liked to have seen."Will of the Alpha" begins with Kandrels "Savage Toys." This tale draws its setting not from steamy leather-clubs or dank dungeons, but instead from the days of colonialism, when the deep jungles of Africa were seen as wild, untamed, savage, and perhaps a bit kinky too. The unexpected setting for this story is accompanied by a light-hearted tone; the story borders just enough on being tongue-in-cheek to make it a quick, enjoyable read, and a fitting introduction to the stories beyond.If "Savage Toys" wants to break the standards of BDSM erotica, then Ianus J. Wolf\'s "The New Toy" relishes in them. In "The New Toy," everything is by the book: we have a submissive at a club, we have a meeting with a Master and Mistress with their new rules of behavior, we have hot sex, and we have cuddle-time afterwards. It would be crass to label this story formulaic, for while it does keep to the formula, it excels at using the formula to great effect. "The New Toy" effectively leads the reader into the kinkier world of BDSM along with its protagonist, learning as he learns what is expected and what will be forthcoming. The story also keeps its characters from falling into stereotypes; they come off the page as sweet, friendly, loving individuals, and the last page of the story only cements their personalities in all the better. "The New Toy" is followed by Mangi\'s "Furlough," and it appears to suffer somewhat for its placement. "Furlough," on its own, is a fine story with only one flaw that affected me and which may not even be an issue for anyone else: midway through the story (and again near the end), the perspective shifts very suddenly and gives us a new protagonist with a new setting. It feels as though an entirely different story begins. Though the outer story provides some context as to what happens, the inner story doesn\'t even reference the outer story and in so doing, leaves me feeling jerked around, having to reinvest myself in the characters. On its own, again, this would not be a major issue, but it\'s placed in the book directly alongside "The New Toy" and "Breaking in," both of which it shares some plot and storyline elements with and neither of which yanked me out of the story in the same way. As a result, they cast an unintentional shadow onto Mangi\'s work.Sparf\'s "Breaking In" and Rechan\'s "Missed" deserve to be considered together, as they both seem more intent than even "Savage Toys" to break with convention. "Breaking In" is the only story to feature a switch protagonist, "Missed" (along with "Infinite Loop") the only to feature a dominant protagonist; "Breaking In" is one of only two bisexual stories, "Missed" is the only lesbian story. Both stories did a wonderful job of subverting my expectations as a reader to great effect. "Breaking In" starts with a scene very similar to that of "Furlough," and since the latter\'s opening scene served primarily as impetus to drive the main character\'s action forward, I expected "Breaking In" to do the same; then the middle of the story hits and we learn that far more interesting things are afoot. I wish "Breaking In" had been longer, if only to give me more time to appreciate the development of its characters. "Missed," too, plays with its reader\'s expectations; this story (the shortest in the book), in fact, doesn\'t have a sex scene at all. But "Missed" makes that very expectation of sex in both the reader\'s and the character\'s mind be a powerful emotional hook leading into a bittersweet ending. Both "Breaking In" and "Missed" stand out as my favorites in the collection.And they are followed by a story that almost stood head and shoulders above them, Ashe\'s "Dinner Theatre." Ashe, in just a few pages, manages to hook me into caring about a committed, loving, and very hot couple, while building up a great level of tension. The stakes in this story are set high; if things go wrong, it could wreck the characters\' lives. The story keeps building itself up higher, and the action races up towards its exciting climax (which does not actually involve any of the characters actually climaxing), but then... it stumbles. The resolution wraps up so nicely and neatly that I almost stopped, set the book down, and said, "Really? Come on. There\'s no way that would actually happen." The final scene of the story returns the focus back to the main characters and their very passionate relationship, bringing back some of the warmth to this story that the scene prior nabbed away. Still, "Dinner Theatre" is a great story and left me eager for more from the author.*"Memories," by Tarl "Voice" Hoch, marks the turn to the deeper, darker side of BDSM; the sex itself is not overly kinky, but here the relationship between the binder and the bound starts to move in a more objectifying direction. This story is difficult to review properly without spoiling a big part of the story; suffice it to say, having read it once, I want to read it again and pick up on nuances I missed the first time, especially to see if I can tell which story points were planned in advance and which occured in the heat of the moment. A good story and easily worth at least two reads.Like "Memories," Nathan Cowan\'s "Infinite Loop" needs more than one reading to catch all the subtlties. "Infinite Loop" is set in the same world as his Foxforce novels. Unfortunately, if the reader has not been exposed to his novels before and wants to read them after "Infinite Loop," this short does spoil a few major plot points in all three current novels. Conversely, if the reader has already read Cowan\'s novels, then this story is a definite treat, revealing some behind-the-scenes action and motivations: I went through the opening scenes with eyes wide and jaw on the floor. "Infinite Loop" lingers perhaps a bit too long on some of the events of the novels (in its description of the Blue Diamond tamers for instance), but as a whole, it plays to the strengths of the story and its author. We are being told more than just a story; we are catching a glimpse of a wide, varied, and interesting world beyond the few characters and setting given here. On top of that, the sex is good, the relationship between the dominant and submissive is well-portrayed - if a bit unsettling - and the ending will once again have you wanting to read through it all a second time. (I will caution the reader not to peek ahead on this story. The illustration on the last page reveals the twist at the end.)While Whyte Yote\'s "The Leather\'s Always Blacker" is the second to last story in "Will of the Alpha," it struck me as being the most extreme, as far as kink goes. Bill, the dominant of this story, dropkicks the reader and the story into high gear a few pages in: if Walton\'s attitude in "Infinite Loop" sent shivers up the reader\'s spine, then Bill in this story may inspire curling up in the corner. After the cages and strict obedience that make up much of the story\'s first two acts, the story falls into a minor lull near the end. The protagonist has come more to terms with the unexpectedly strong world of kink he has found himself in, and without his curiosity and confusion to pull the story forward, the final scenes lose a bit of their impact. Despite the erotic puppy play foreshadowed on the first page, the actual event did not carry as much impact as I would have liked. Part of this may be that due to the presence of Tenso, an otherwise secondary character, whose relationship with Bill seemed more interesting than the main character\'s own predicament; it makes me hope for another story showing more about Tenso\'s experiences."Attachments," by H.A. Kirsch, rounds out the end of the book, in the spot reserved for the kinkiest of stories in a very kinky collection. Nevertheless, I found the story not as intense as the two stories that preceded it. "Attachments" earns its place at the end of the book, in my mind, due to the unique nature of the story\'s main character, which may squick some readers. I read the beginning of the story in a somewhat detached fashion, not quite getting into the kink myself, but finding Kirsch\'s description, characterization, and sci-fi extrapolation of the what-ifs strong enough to carry me forward. The latter part of the story then transitions to well-written pony play and ends on a satisfying note. In addition to the many stories present, Elijah Lapso contributed two one-page poems.

It's a lighthearted, funny, easy to read book that takes perceptions and turns them upside down. If you don't mind a little irreverence and an occasional swear word, then not only will you enjoy this book, it may make you think a little as well. What if perceptions aren't always what they seem?Although Tom Holt crafts most of his stories from the basis of myths and legends and sets them in modern times and Terry Pratchett created a whole original world, I always associate these two authors in my mind. Maybe it's because I won't take either of their books on public transport for fear of looking crazy as I smile, snicker and cackle to myself. Maybe it's because despite the different way of going about it, they both have a similar way of making you see familiar concepts differently. Either way, they never disappoint.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Very funny but it was also exploring the nature of good and evil. The nature of good and evil theme confused me though. At first Tom Holt was using St George and the dragon in their legendary (English) roles and we appeared to be looking at good and evil in a cultural sense. Then he introduced a coachload of demons and references to heaven and remembered that St George was one of the Christian saints. He seemed to be saying that good and evil are defined by religions. That's when I started to get confused because he only referred to Christianity, but seemed to be arguing that good and evil are constructs of religions in general. I really didn't understand that, because athiests seem to agree with religious folk about some aspects of good and evil (e.g. murder and torture are bad things - there are more obviously). That suggests that good and evil are concepts which exist outside of religion. In the end, I decided that I just didn't understand the serious point that he was making and I just enjoyed the humour. \n         ", u"\n           \n           Here, Holt revisits the legend of St George and the Dragon, when the spirits of the originals come to possess statues made by a master sculptor. There are musings on the nature of good and evil, when St George turns out to be kind of a jerk, and the dragon just wants to live his life. Other statues come to life as well, and Kurt Lundqvist makes a return appearance. There's also a lost contingent of demons from Hell with whom the saint hangs around, his reasoning being that they're actually all on the same side. There are some plot threads that don't really go much of anywhere, but overall I liked this one.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'32012126', u'Smith College Theatre Workshop Plays; An Anthology (1918-1921)', u'196', u'\n14961354\nSmith College Theatre Workshop\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14961354.Smith_College_Theatre_Workshop\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'8', u'29', u'Wentworth Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Excerpt: Connection Timeout Joseph Beuys (German pronunciation: May 12, 1921 - January 23, 1986) was a German performance artist, sculptor, installation artist, graphic artist, art theorist and pedagogue of art. His extensive work is grounded in concepts of humanism, social philosophy and anthroposophy; it culminates in his "extended definition of art" and the idea of social sculpture as a gesamtkunstwerk, for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping society and politics. His career was characterized by passionate, even acrimonious public debate, but he is now regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Joseph Beuys was born in Krefeld, the son of the merchant Josef Jakob Beuys (1888-1958) and Johanna Maria Margarete Beuys (born Hulsermann, 1889-1974). The parents had moved from Geldern to Krefeld in 1910, and Beuys was born there on May 12, 1921. In autumn of that year the family moved to Kleve, an industrial town in the Lower Rhine region of Germany, close to the Dutch border. There, Joseph attended primary school (Katholische Volksschule) and secondary/high- school (Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve, now the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium). His teachers considered him to have a talent for drawing; he also took piano- and cello lessons. On several occasions he visited the studio of the Flemish painter and sculptor Achilles Moortgat. Other interests of note include Nordic history and mythology and especially the natural sciences.

G. Wells, was a prolific English writer in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, and social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels, and Wells is called the father of science fiction, along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898).', u'436', u'3.69', u'165', [], [u"\n           \n           Hard one to rate. There are some stories in here that are pretty good, but the entire collection will live in my memory as a showcase of Wells' racist and eugenics-friendly opinions. Yes, this is partly a product of his time, but these weren't universally accepted opinions, even then. It made far too many of the stories an unpleasant read. It has the benefit of being short, though, and the title story is a fairly good read. But otherwise, I just can't recommend it.\n         ", u"\n           \n           A collection of some of Wells's first published stories, where the fantastic and the jocular rub shoulders to good effect.Highlights were numerous. 'Through a Window' was like a condensed version of the script for Rear Window. 'A Deal in Ostriches' involved an inspired sting about a swallowed diamond and an auction involving five of those crazy birds. '\xc6pyornis Island' was a shaggy dog story, or rather a shaggy bird story about an adventurer washed up on an atoll with an egg of the extinct elephant bird, which hatches.Other stories featured all sorts of dangerous, everyday items, such as chemicals, flowers, fauna, and even self-portraits. All the tales are told with expert economy, verve, and humour.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Technically, \u201cSelect Conversations With An Uncle\u201d which was published earlier in 1895 was Wells\u2019 first collection of stories, but the stories from that collection have largely been forgotten, while this collection, \u201cThe Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents\u201d, contains a few stories which have long been remembered as early classics. The fourth of four books published in 1895, this collection contains 15 works of short fiction which were originally published between December of 1893, and March of 1895, mostly in \u201cPall Mall Budget\u201d (or \u201cPall Mall Gazette\u201d), but there is one story which was published originally in \u201cBlack and White\u201d and one from \u201cThe St. James Gazette\u201d.The collection opens with \u201cThe Stolen Bacillus\u201d, a short story which can definitely be considered science fiction. In this an unnamed visitor of a Bacteriologist preys on the Bacteriologists ego to boast about the dangerous strains of bacteria he has on hand. The visitor turns out to be an anarchist who steals a vial with bacteria to use as a weapon, resulting in a chase, with a surprise ending. Published originally in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d on June 21st of 1894, this story predicts the fears of terrorists using biological weapons.The next story is \u201cThe Flowering of the Strange Orchid\u201d, another science fiction story, in which a man (Winter-Wedderburn) is tired of having an uneventful life and purchases some orchids from a collector who died, one of which is a very unusual specimen and provides him with an event in his life which he so desperately wanted. Published on August 2nd of 1894 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d, this story is an early example of using a previously unknown species as subject-matter.Next up is \u201cIn The Avu Observatory\u201d, which was published on August 9th of 1894 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d. This story, like the one before uses an unusual species as subject-matter. In this case it is a large bat-like creature which attacks an astronomer\u2019s assistant during a night when he is alone making observations.\u201cThe Triumphs Of A Taxidermist\u201d was published on March 3rd of 1894, and unlike the previous stories this one is not really science fiction. Here it is a narrator telling of a conversation he had with a Taxidermist, who admitted he had created \u201cnew species\u201d in order to satisfy his clients.\u201cA Deal In Ostriches\u201d was published on December 20th of 1894 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d. This story is also not science fiction, but it is a clever story (again told by a taxidermist, but not clear if it is meant to be the same one) about how an Ostrich was worth three hundred pounds. \u201cThrough A Window\u201d, published in \u201cBlack and White\u201d on August 25th, 1894 is like an early version of \u201cRear Window\u201d. Here we have a man (Bailey) who is immobilized due to an injury who watches a manhunt through his window.\u201cThe Temptation of Harringay\u201d was published in \u201cThe St. James Gazette\u201d on February 9th of 1895. This fantasy story is about an artist who is desperate to paint a subject he has created in his mind, but who cannot get it right. The Devil comes to him and tries to buy the artist\u2019s soul with the promise of a few masterpieces.\u201cThe Flying Man\u201d was published in December of 1893 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Gazette\u201d. This is a story told from the point of view of a lieutenant who is explaining how he gained a reputation among the natives as \u201ca flying man\u201d.\u201cThe Diamond Maker\u201d was published on August 16th of 1894 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d. In this science fiction story, the narrator relates the tale of a man who has invented a means of making his own diamonds.\u201c\xc6pyornis Island\u201d was published on December 27th of 1894 in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d. Similar to the two stories earlier, this one again uses an unusual species as subject-matter, though in this case the story is much better thought out and developed. Here the narrator tells the story of how he found the bones of an \xc6pyornis.Next up is my personal favorite in the book, \u201cThe Remarkable Case of Davidson\u2019s Eyes\u201d, which was published in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d on March 28th of 1895. In this story, the title character (Davidson), after a lightning strike, is not able to see what is in front of him, but instead sees a tropical scene. Over time he eventually recovers, but later he meets someone who tells him a story which describes what he had seen perfectly.\u201cThe Lord of the Dynamos\u201d was published on September 6th, 1894, in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d. This is another good story, about a poor foreign laborer who comes to worship the large Dynamo where he works.\u201cThe Hammerpond Park Burglary\u201d is a clever story about a thief (Teddy Watkins) who is trying to steal Lady Aveling\u2019s jewels. It was published originally in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d on July 5th of 1894.\u201cA Moth \u2013 Genus Novo\u201d was published in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d on March 28th, of 1895. This is another good story about two rival scientists who have a professional feud, which is ended by the untimely death of one of them. The other then is tormented by a new species of Moth which he is unable to capture, and which nobody else is able to see.The collection closes with \u201cThe Treasure In The Forest\u201d, which was published in \u201cThe Pall Mall Budget\u201d on August 23rd of 1894. This is the story of two men (Evans and Hooker) who overhear a discussion of a treasure, and then make the mistake of trying to rush ahead and recover it first.This is far from the best collection of Wells\u2019 short stories, but it is interesting because you can see some of his development as a writer between the earliest stories in this collection, and those which were written later on. This is true even though it isn\u2019t even two years between the publication of the first and last stories. Though some of these stories would be considered speculative fiction, many of them are fairly standard short stories.\n', u'\n           \n           Most of the stories are highly enjoyable. A mixed bag, but most of the nuts were good. I was stunned to find two 1-star reviews because of H.G. Wells\u2019 \u201cracist and eugenics-friendly opinions\u201d; while I agree that a few stories were a bit pointless, and that the author used to have some rather strong opinions, only a dickhead brainwashed by today\u2019s political correctness would get rabid upon encountering the word \u201cnigger\u201d\u2014yes, it\u2019s \u201cnigger,\u201d not \u201cthe N-word,\u201d you motherfuckers! This is the word most people were using back then, disparagingly or not! (OK, he could have used \u201cnegro,\u201d yet he didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t Mark Twain.)\n', u'\n           \n           A very good selection of Short Stories.

Esta detective-polic\xeda a la que le encanta "desheredada" y que atrae los problemas a porrillo va a desvelar el misterio de la isla de las gaviotas. Una historia que narra primero las vidas paralelas de varios personajes que luego se van a reunir en la isla y despu\xe9s se meter\xe1 de lleno en el misterio que rodea a la isla donde celebrar\xe1 su viaje de novios.Yo la recomiendo.

And think what curating is all about. This book starts from this simple premise: thinking the activity of curating. To do that, it distinguishes between 'curating' and 'the curatorial'. If 'curating' is a gamut of professional practices for setting up exhibitions, then 'the curatorial' explores what takes place on the stage set up, both intentionally and unintentionally, by the curator. It therefore refers not to the staging of an event, but to the event of knowledge itself. In order to start thinking about curating, this book takes a new approach to the topic. Instead of relying on conventional art historical narratives (for example, identifying the moments when artistic and curatorial practices merged or when the global curator-author was first identified), this book puts forward a multiplicity of perspectives that go from the anecdotal to the theoretical and from the personal to the philosophical. These perspectives allow for a fresh reflection on curating, one in which, suddenly, curating becomes an activity that implicates us all (artists, curators, and viewers), not just as passive recipients, but as active members. As such, the Curatorial is a book without compromise: it asks us to think again, fight against sweeping art historical generalizations, the sedimentation of ideas and the draw of the sound bite. Curating will not stop, but at least with this book it can begin to allow itself to be challenged by some of the most complex and ethics-driven thought of our times.", u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'33543581', u'Long Way Gone', u'173', u'\n16220293\nDiscordsAdvocate\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16220293.DiscordsAdvocate\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2012', u'4', u'16', u'Fimfiction', u'<p>He hailed from the Rift, the home of his people.

Much younger and quite a bit more handsome than Mr. Bent he makes Diana\u2019s heart flutter like it has never done before. In addition, he plays like a dream and her stepdaughter Samantha likes him. So, even though he makes her think of things no lady should think of she hires him as the piano tutor for her Samantha and even considers taking lessons herself. But the looks he\u2019s giving her added to her own naughty thoughts have her believing he might teach her more than the piano. She\u2019s always been so proper. Dare she risk making her desire known to him?Very well-written this short story is a wonderful quick snack. Diana is a lovely character and Nicholas nearly sets the pages on fire. Well, this is an ebook, but if I had pages they\u2019d be red hot. He\u2019s so yummy! I like the twist at the end, too.

The mourning period was suffered for tradition's sake and not for the loss of a loved spouse. Lady Diana\u2019s marriage was one of duty and enjoyed a mutual respect. Love never entered into the equation. Now, the still young widow was left with a comfortable life and the care of her twelve-year-old stepdaughter, Samantha. Wednesday was the day Samantha\u2019s piano lesson with Mr. Bent, a thin, bent, middle-aged man with a humor and disposition, sorely lacking. Lady Diana is surprised when Mr. Nicholas Jameson\u2019s arrival is announced by the butler. Mr. Jameson explains that the regular tutor has been called away on personal business and he is here as a substitute. An easy report is immediately established between the piano tutor and the widow.Nicholas proves to be an accomplished pianist, competent, patient, and understanding teacher, and Diana is soon persuaded to become one of his pupils. He teaches her more than music scales and a budding romance is soon well on its way to fruition. \u201cThe sunlight claps the earth, and the moonbeams kiss the sea: what are all these kissings worth, if thou kiss not me.\u201d- Percy Shelley  Never underestimate the power of a kiss. More powerful than the pen or the sword, a single kiss can change the world. This is yet another regency romance that sweeps you along as a leaf on the wind. The tale is much grander than the comparative length of the novella would suggest. Kisses and innocent foreplay serve as a prelude of what is suggestively promised. \n", u"\n           \n           I enjoyed this short story. It was well written. It was hot.

For anyone who has suffered from that unrequited love that burns like a fever will be able to relate uncannily well with this book. Unfortunately the ending is such that it inspired many people to use it like a template for their own lives when faced with a similar situation. While finishing up this book I wondered whether Goethe was ever aware or thought about the painful actions his book inspired. This is a fictionalized autobiography of Goethe's own experience of being in love with a woman he could never have. The experience was obviously very painful for him. His writing style has powerful clarity that can easily pull you into the story causing you to ache with the main character and laugh at the same time. To me this was an example of the dark-side of romanticism. The main character, Werther, was so obsessed and fixated on Charlotta (the woman he loves) that it was as if he wasn't even seeing her anymore. What he was in love with was an idea, not actually her, he was in love with his own ideal of her. This is the grand delusion that romantics feed themselves and they do it to such excess that their behavior seems pitiable. I would only recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what obsession with another human being looks like. This mindset is as unhealthy as attaining the object, and I say object because that is what the idealized Charlotta became, would likely only reveal his delusion. Romanticism is an example of looking for a personal messiah in love. Someone who we can pin all of our hopes and dreams on to pull us out of the human condition we find ourselves stuck in. A quest for transcendence through the love of another. But placing that responsibility on the shoulders of someone else will always disappoint and rightly so. We can not give to another what only we can do for ourselves.I would only cautiously recommend this book. Realists could handle it, but dreamers beware.\n", u'\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           Thackeray wrote this very glib verse synopsis of the tale:Werther had a love for Charlotte Such as words could never utter;Would you know how first he met her? She was cutting bread and butter.Charlotte was a married lady, And a moral man was Werther,And, for all the wealth of Indies, Would do nothing for to hurt her.So he sighed and pined and ogled, And his passion boiled and bubbled,Till he blew his silly brains out, And no more was by it troubled.Charlotte, having seen his body Borne before her on a shutter,Like a well-conducted person, Went on cutting

        ', u"\n           \n           I couldn't help but imagine young Werther as a high school, tweeting about all his troubles to the ether. So, without further ado, I present to you: The Tweets of Young Werther.This is the kind of book that high school teachers should be making self-absorbed teenagers read. They can totally relate, both to the intense feelings of emotion and the complete conviction that no one in the world has ever felt the same way before. I couldn't relate that well, because really Werther just needs to man up and bang someone else, but I still (inexplicably) liked this book. Actually, my affection is explicable: we're talking about Goethe, after all.I should really step away from photoshop and get back to work.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I have read most english translations of this remarkable work and, while Burton Pike's translation is the most popular currently, it leaves a lot to be desired. It is too simple and misses the high points. The best translation (in my opinion) and the one that I keep going back to is Catherine Hutter's version \u2014 The Sorrows of Young Werther and Selected Writings.\u201cThis is another one of those creatures whom, like the pelican, I have fed with the blood of my own heart... There were special circumstances close at hand, urgent, troubling me, and they resulted in the state of mind that produced Werther. I had lived, loved, and suffered much... That's what it was.\u201d- Johann Wolfgang von GoetheI was brought back to Goethe's version after coming across a parody. I loved the aspects that were touched on in the retold version. John Zelazny, the writer of the parody, does not hide from the original and makes this clear. It is a marvelously done parody and takes on similar themes of class, religion and suicide. I love how both books reflect on each other and think everyone interested in Werther should check out The Sorrows of Young Mike. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'32998934', u'Craigslist Top Selling Secrets:

So sy kan haar nie worrie oor my gekerm oor simpel goed nie. Ek weet ons vrek van die honger, maar \'n karretjiemeid kan droom. Droom kos niks.Eerstens wil ek net se Kirby van der Merwe, die vertaler, het \'n ongelooflike job gedoen. Ek kan nie glo hierdie boek is uit Engels vertaal nie. Dis so beautiful geskryf. Tweedens het die karakters so diep in my hart ingekruip - veral Witpop. Ek kan nie onthou wanneer laas ek so vir \'n karakter "gevoel" het nie. Ek het gesnik soos ek huil vir haar, en haar hele gesin se omstandighede. Miskiet is ook \'n verskriklike sterk karakter, en mens weet sommer van die begin af dat jy hier te doen het met \'n psigopaat.Ek wil nie weer \'n kind begrawe nie. As \'n kind regtag honger is, vir \'n lang tyd honger gely het, dan huil nie die kwaai gehuil van \'n kind wat kos soek nie. Dis so vreemde gehuil, so hahaa-hahaa, dagin en daguit vir dae en dae aaneen. As hy stil raak, dan weet jy hy het opgegee. Dan kyk hy vir jou met ogies wat weet Mamma en Pappa kan nie die pyn wegvat nie.Die Storie: Vyftien jaar lank kruip Muis al weg. En noudat die Karoo so droog is, wil haar man Kapok hul donkiekarretjie in Leeu-Gamka se rigting draai \u2013 die een plek wat Muis nooit weer wil sien nie, want dit is hier waar die wrede Miskiet vir haar wag om haar terug te kry. Klein Witpop is opgewonde. Dalk kan sy nou televisie kyk en skool toe gaan. Haar broer Fansie hoop daar sal meer kos vir hom en hul babasussie Sponsie wees. Maar die duiwel is los in Leeu-Gamka en hulle moet desperaat vlug op hul karretjie. Sonder dokumente wat wys jy bestaan, kan die polisie jou nie veel help nie.\n         ', u'\n           \n           "As ons op Oudtshoorn kom, dan kan die kinders vir my s\xea ek is \'n karretjiemeid, maar ek gaan nie \'n stink ene wees nie.""Die kleintjie wat dood is, is dood van koors.

"twee russians en \'n groot tjips," s\xea hy. "En \'n tweeliter-Coke." Fansie begin agter my te lag toe hy sien wat sy pa maak en Sponsie klap haar handjies."Wat \'n hartverskeurende verhaal van \'n swerwer gesin in die Karoo. Daar was dele in die boek wat so hartseer was dat ek nie eers kon huil nie. Elke karakter was verskriklik goed gevorm, maar die een wat die diepste in my hart gekruip het was Witpop. Hierdie arme dogtertjie wat se grootste wens is dat sy skoolskoene, pads en pienk roll-on kan kry. Ek het verskriklik jammer gevoel vir die ma ook wat net vir haar kinders indentiteitsboekies wil kry, sodat hulle kan bestaan. Ook, so vir arme Fansie wat sy ma en pa se geld moet wegsteek as hulle dronk is om seker te maak dat hulle nie al die geld vir drank gebruik nie.Ek kan myself dit nie indink om so \'n bestaan te maak nie. Om die heeltyd te moet rondtrek, om nie te weet wanneer jy jou volgende ete gaan h\xea nie, om in vrees te moet leef vir iemand wat jou wil vermoor, om \'n kind aan die dood te moet afstaan agv hongerte. Die boek het my weer laat besef hoe gelukkig ons is en so ook ons kinders - wat nie opgewonde raak oor russians, chips en coke nie, maar dit as \'n "given" aanvaar.Ek sal verseker die boek aanbeveel.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Vir sommige beteken die gebrek aan identiteitsdokumente net \u2018n lastige struikel blok om te register vir skool, \u2018n bank rekening oop te maak of om \u2018n SIM kaart te bekom, maar vir die nomadiese familie in hierdie hartseer storie het dit \u2018n doodsaak geword. Muis en haar man, Kapok en kinders Witpop, Sponsie en seun Fansie, is karretjiemense, wat eindeloos swerf deur die Karoo op hul donkiekar. Hulle oorleef deur los werkies te doen op plase in die Groot Karoo. Veral Witpop en Fansie het in my hart geklim al was hulle so uiteenlopend. Fansie \u2018n kind van die veld en Witpop so pynlik bewus van die familie se armoede, smag om net \u2018n paar skoene en roll-on te kan besit.Die storie volg hierdie familie wat noodgedwonge moet terug gaan na Leeu-Gamka waar, Jan (Fansie se regte pa) 15 jaar tevore vermoor is. Muis moet haar grootste vreese konfronteer en probeer om haar familie bymekaar te hou in die proses.Dis moeilik om te glo hierdie is \u2018n vertaling uit Engels want die taal gebruik het so eg Afrikaans gevoel. Dit was \u2018n hartseer maar ook interesante blik in die lewe van hierdie karretjiemense van die Karoo en word hoog aanbeveel.\n', u"\n           \n           I haven't been to the Karoo but with this wonderful novel I could get a sense of how life there is like. Carol Campbell is fantastic in that she paints a picture with words of the atmosphere and characters; with your imagination being the canvas. A masterpiece of a very thrilling, humbling and very heart breaking tale. The story was gripping and the story and characters well engraved in my mind even after not reading it after a few days; IT WAS JUST THAT VIVID!!! I cant wait to read another of her novels.This book has taught me to count my blessings and never to forget to help and build those who are invisible in society. The little we have can mean a lot to those have nothing.Thank you Carol Campbell.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I was entranced by this short, but vivid, account of the lives of the karretjiemense of the Karoo. I loved the way each character adds insight and detail so that we see their way of life from different points of view. Their humanity is intensely moving. There is a beautifully developed tension throughout the story which holds the reader's attention, as does the use of colloquial language and the description of the Karoo around Leeu Gamka and the Swartberg. I am tempted to give it 4.5 stars.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'15455584', u'La Diferenciacion de Productos Agrarios', u' ', u'\n6321615\nElena Lopez Diaz-Delgado\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6321615.Elena_Lopez_Diaz_Delgado\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29289742', u'Songs from the Wayside', u'136', u'\n15027428\nNinette Maine Lowater\nCreator\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15027428.Ninette_Maine_Lowater\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2015', u'11', u'20', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

It reminds me a lot of Rocky, Vol. 1: The Big Payback, where puke and physiological needs took center stage. I'm happy when I read a comic with no puke inside it. I don't really like those. What's the point of showing yellowish underwear?! BLEAH!It was informative because it told the story of the Beatles before being the Beatles. But at the same time the Beatles do make a poor show as human beings. I don't know how to explain... They're idols: they should stay idols... I don't want to see their dirty underwear.When it comes to graphic novels and the Beatles I do prefer Arne Bellstorf'2 Baby's in Black: Astrid Kirchherr, Stuart Sutcliffe, and The Beatles. There are some moment when these two graphic novel interweave but Bellstorf's work focuses more on the Hamburg period. And it's way nicer than Kunnas'. I was really disappointed in this comics.

The first story is written by Beth Williamson, and the second by Robin Danner.I enjoyed reading this quite a lot. For me, the first story was the stronger of the two, but they were both quite well-developed and entertaining. I also particularly like the way both romances were given top billing in their own stories, but working on the same premise and with plots that developed loosely together. Beth Williamson is an auto-buy for me, even though I may not always rate her the highest, since I love the way she writes sassy heroines with guts but depth, and I love the western/cowboy historical setting. Her heroines are not just suffering from severe impulse control like so many sassy/spitfire heroines seem to (and like her younger sister does in the second book). Yes, they have guts, but they also have an inner discourse on risks and rewards. Also, her heroes are as well-developed as her heroines, something the second book lacked, in my opinion.The endings of both books are a bit simplistic and all the loose ends are tied up quickly and neatly. A bit too neatly for my liking. In short stories, I do appreciate a bit of the unresolved at the ending, just to leave you wandering, and these stories didn't even try, which was a shame.I'm not sure I particularly liked the hero in the first book, nor the heroine in the second, but the stories were very entertaining and made a lovely interlude between other genres for me.3 stars.\n         ", u'\n           \n           By: Beth Williamson & Robin DannerPublished By: Liquid Silver PublishingAge Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 4Book Blog For: GMTAReview:"Vixen Virgins" by Beth Williamson and Robin Danner come together and intertwined a two part story under this title. The first story is \'The Outlaw\'s Virgin by Beth WilliamsonThe first story deals with Lady Margaret Travers and her sister Millicent are on there way by train to their Aunt Gertrude. Why is Margaret running away? This is due to the fact she is running from an arranged marriage to some \'American Earl.\' While heading to Corpus Christi, Texas they train is robbed and all of her money is now gone. What will she do? Well, this is the time that I say you must pick up this read to what will happen to her and her sister. the second story: \'The Sheriff\'s Vixen\' by Robin DannerThe second story is of the sister, Lady Millicent Travers who had been traveling with her sister Margaret but were robbed. We now find that Millicent has been left behind in Beaumont, Texas while Margaret is gone with her horse Wind Dancer to find the bandit that had robbed them. Millicent finds a job at a saloon serving drinks and that is where she will find trouble and it seems like Benjamin Spalding who the sheriff of Beaumont will be there \'to stop her in her tracks.\' Now, this is where I will say you must continue reading "Vixen Virgins\' to see how this will come out. It will be most interesting and down right funny.I found all of the characters in both stories were well structured and completed each other. You will definitely love reading with the combination of the Regency women (Vixen Virgins) and the heat of these American Western men this will be a story you will not want to miss.

In wide-ranging writings mostly dating since 2006, he forthrightly argues for a theologically sound understanding of the church. And he pursues a multi-faceted critique of the feckless ways in which actual churches--ministers and laity--balk and betray their rightful calling to witness in word and deed to God. He is especially critical of the practical ways in which congregations become no more than mirror images of their sociopolitical milieu, whether to the right or to the left. Hence the quarrel, trenchantly pursued in major essays, blogs, and spiritual reflections on his own past. But it remains crystal clear to Jones in his learned and profound confession that it is his beloved church with which he quarrels and about which he still has extravagant hopes. A Lover's Quarrel is a book appropriate for ministers and laity, students and professors, and learned skeptics.", u'4', u'3.50', u'2', [], [u'\n           \n           Joe Jones is a retired Disciples of Christ theologian. He is some what unique in that he has had an affinity for Karl Barth (an affinity I share as a Disciples pastor/theologian) and for John Howard Yoder. His theological work is rooted in Wittgenstein\'s concern for words/grammar, and he is troubled by the lack of theological sophistication among many in the church -- especially the clergy of his own denomination.In this book, we find a collection of essays, blog posts, and sermons. Most have been written since the publication of an earlier collection was published in 2005 (On Being the Church of Jesus Christ in Tumultuous Times). The book is divided into four parts. Part one focuses on theological matters -- "Ecumenical Theologizing with Ecclesial Friends." I personally found this section to be the most provocative -- as he takes on the questions of what it means to live out a "radical orthodoxy." He talks about theological method, spiritual formation, salvation, discipleship, and the eucharist.In part two, writing from a Yoder-influenced perspective, he tackles matters of politics from the perspective of a Gospel of hope. Yes, his politics is liberal, but his roots are in the gospel -- for the question is whether we are American first or Christian first. In Part Three, he takes up a number of conversations -- beginning with the story of his life growing up in Oklahoma and on to his decision to pursue theology rather than law -- being the son of a respected judge. He takes us to Yale Divinity School and introduces us to H. Richard Niebuhr. Finally, in Part four, we have before us a number of sermons preached for various occasions from his daughter\'s ordination to the funeral of a friend. In each of these pieces we are drawn into the biblical story and the need to draw close to the God witnessed to by this story. What comes through these various pieces is that Jones is committed to the church and to the one who calls the church into existence. We hear a clarion call to consider the importance of the Trinity to the life of this church -- a call that is not always well received in a church that is doggedly non-creedal (at least of the traditional kind).Being that this is a collection of various kinds of written materials, different pieces will speak differently to a person, but as with the Pauline epistles, these are occasional pieces that give witness to the gospel for our day. \n'], 0]!!!![u'25445388', u'Bunka to wa--Chikaratoshite no bunka Daiichiwa', u' ', u'\n1423989\nKunio Kishida\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479442033p5/1423989.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479442033p2/1423989.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1423989.Kunio_Kishida\n4.00\n1\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'34375933', u'Slaan door', u'92', u'\n16486394\nLebbis & Jansen\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16486394.Lebbis_Jansen\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'1997', u'1', u'1', u'Novella', u"U kunt gaan genieten van acht van de twaalf afleveringen van het tv-programma 'Jansen slaat door!'.

Patterns of ecological succession in tropical forests are insufficiently understood, partly because results are scattered through a large number of case studies reported in academic articles. So far, no publication has attempted to bring these different case studies together to identify common patters and trends. The goal of the book is to review the different case studies, and identify common patterns of ecological succession in fallowed swiddens, as well as to pinpoint the factors that cause ecological succession in some areas to differ from those in other areas. The book is organised in four different sections: forest structure, forest diversity, species composition, and the factors that contribute to differences in forest recovery rates (the number of times the field was burned, the length of fallow period, the type of soil, and the type of forest). This book is an important contribution to tropical forestry and shifting cultivation. Deforestation and forest degradation are the largest sources of CO2, and shifting cultivation is one of the main culprits. For this (and other economic and political) reason governments attempt to curtail shifting cultivation by shortening the years the fields can be left fallow, or outright outlawing the farming practice. Yet, there is insufficient understanding of the processes of ecological succession in fallows, which raises the questions as to whether the policy fulfils its objectives.', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'34967837', u'Lewd Necromancer: Raiding Hearts', u' ', u'\n7795523\nEden Redd\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442964193p5/7795523.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442964193p2/7795523.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7795523.Eden_Redd\n3.67\n619\n41\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'Warning: The tale you are about to read is a story of sexual creatures, human or otherwise.

Artista senza genio, ha ripiegato nell\u2019expertise di pittura per un\u2019importante casa d\u2019aste. Le sue giornate sono disciplinate dalla regola inflessibile che pi\xf9 sono uguali l\u2019una all\u2019altra, pi\xf9 il tempo rallenter\xe0 la sua corsa spietata. Naturalmente, la vita supera tutte le barriere.

Negli stessi giorni, un amico gli ha affidato per una vendita all\u2019asta un quadro del pittore F\xe9lix Vallotton, dipinto dotato di un\u2019affascinante, inusuale sensualit\xe0. Da questo momento, per caso e per necessit\xe0, il viaggio di Adrian attraverso l\u2019esistenza cambia forma: da uguale routine dorata diventa una movimentata commedia di scambi, equivoci, suspense; e la distaccata, elegante rassegnazione si tramuta in una saporosissima vendetta del desiderio.', u'1535', u'3.83', u'799', [(u'to-read', 546)], [u'\nThe Last Weynfeldt opens with a beautiful woman threatening to jump off a balcony to her death. She decides not to, but once you get to know this character, the scene seems completely unconvincing in retrospect. There are things going wrong in her life, but nothing in the way she is portrayed suggests depression or suicidal feelings. Lorena is a shoplifter, a grifter, a con artist, and she becomes the obsession of the protagonist, Adrian Weynfeldt, an independently wealthy 50-something Zurich native who is a complete gentleman, from his manners and his antiques-filled apartment down to his cufflinks. Soon after they meet in a bar he is paying her bills and not getting anything in return. It is interesting to see how far Weynfeldt can be pushed, how much of a patsy he is willing to be; not only is he Lorena\'s pushover, but he hosts weekly dinners at expensive restaurants for various groups of friends, none of whom seem to really like him, but can\'t seem to do without his hospitality. When one friend wants to make himself over in the Marquesas Islands, Weynfeldt gets out his checkbook and asks how much.The main plotline involves the forgery of this painting by F\xe9lix Vallotton:Femme nue devant une salamandre, 1900.Its owner, a friend of Weynfeldt, is getting decrepit and needs cash to move into a retirement apartment on Lake Como. He decides the painting must be sold, but he can\'t bear to part with it, so he has another friend of theirs forge a copy. He gives the copy to Weynfeldt to sell at auction (Weynfeldt is an expert at an art auction house). Will Weynfeldt sell the copy, or the original? This is the crux of the novel. Along the way Lorena has a fling with a fellow grifter who sells designer clothes at the boutique where she was caught shoplifting, and they conspire to squeeze even more cash out of the seemingly hapless Weynfeldt.Despite the emphasis on the Vallotton painting, of which there is much, the novel never really feels "set" in the art world. Weynfeldt goes to the office every day and has brief conversations with his assistant about the auction catalog, but there is only one unexciting scene that takes place at an auction. The most drama in the book is when Lorena stuffs a silk Prada dress in her tiny purse and is then stopped by the store\'s proprietress upon leaving.Mention must be made of the eccentricities in translation. The plural of "still life" is "still lifes," not "still lives." Eyeliner pencils don\'t have "lids," but "caps." (And the eyeliner pencil which Lorena uses to vandalize the Vallotton painting on p. 175 has become a lipstick on p. 238.) A top is awkwardly described as "low-cut, belly-free" - midriff-baring is surely what is meant. Then there\'s that favorite trendy error of everyone everywhere now, free reign instead of free rein. It\'s a horse metaphor, people. Not a royalty metaphor.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Adrian Weynfeldt initially comes across as empathetic, passive almost a misfit, suffering from bouts of melancholy, he\u2019s a bit lonely. A true gentleman, he can\u2019t seem to shake his proper upbringing mixed with painful moments of the phases of his life. As we become more intimate with Adrian we learn he is quite street smart, savvy and a keen observer, extremely aware of both self as well as surroundings including peers. His stealth side really kicks in when he becomes involved with the dicey Lorena. Lorena a blatant user borderline grifter, however she displays a conscious, which is questionable in its intent. When these two first meet you wonder if they will ultimately compliment each other, but we quickly discover differently. Slowly the tables turn and Adrian becomes the puppet master.Great twist, a wonderfully crafted story proving the good guy finishes last and prevails, along with judging a book by its cover isn\u2019t always wise. Adrian is memorable without a doubt.Suter entertains the reader through his details and characters. He strings the peruser along creating a build up, including a few twist and turns until the curtain reveals the apex towards the end providing a more than satisfying reading adventure. Excellent glimpse into the captivating art world.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I received an advanced review copy of this title from New Vessel Press through Edelweiss. New Vessel Press will publish the English translation of this book in February of 2016, but the book was so good that I couldn\u2019t wait that long to review it. The central figure of the book, Adrian Weynfeldt, is just what the title suggests: he is the last of his family and he is not married and has no children. Adrian\u2019s parents had him later in life and when they died they left Adrian an extensive inheritance which includes two buildings that are prime real estate in Zurich.Fifty-year-old Adrian lives alone on the top floor of one of his opulent buildings. His massive apartment is filled with costly art work and antique furniture. Because of his family\u2019s wealth Adrian doesn\u2019t have to work, but he does because he loves his occupation as an expert art historian for an auction house in Zurich. The descriptions of various artwork and the process of art auctions is a fascinating aspect of the book that captivated my attention.Adrian is mannered to a fault. He doesn\u2019t ask questions when he should and he is always paying for his friends\u2019 lavish dinners and funding their attempts at careers. Every Thursday is lunch with his younger friends and Adrian always excuses himself towards the end of the meal and quietly pays the very expensive bill. Adrian is kind, polite and unassuming and it as very sad to see his so-called friends take advantage of his good nature.This book is one of those page turners that grabs you right from the first scene. Adrian is sitting at one of his favorite bars in Zurich when in walks an interesting woman, in her mid-thirties who basically invites herself up to Adrian\u2019s apartment. He realizes that she is rather intoxicated, so in true Adrian fashion, he feels it would be wrong to sleep with her. In the middle of the night, Adrian wakes up to find this woman, whose name he figures out is Lorena, standing on his balustrade and ready to jump to her death. After he talks her off the ledge, Adrian finds that he can\u2019t stop thinking about Lorena even though he doesn\u2019t know very much about her.It turns out that Lorena has tried to barely squeak out a living by modeling for small companies and catalogues. She has had a tough life and her latest relationship ended disastrously when she found out her boyfriend had a wife and three children. Lorena teams up with a small-time con artist named Pedroni and together they decide to try and swindle Adrian out of some of his money. But Lorena seems to have fallen for Adrian, more so than she is willing to admit to herself, and we are left wondering if she can really cheat him after all.Adrian and Lorena also become involved in an attempted art forgery and a great part of the suspense of the book lies in wondering whether or not Adrian\u2019s keen eye for art will be able to detect the forgery and stop the sale of this piece before it ruins his career. But Lorena\u2019s influence has most definitely thrown some chaos into his otherwise ordered and neat life. The circumstances surrounding the forged art, the sexual tension between Adrian and Lorena and the fascinating character of Adrian himself kept me wondering what was going to happen and wanting more.I highly recommend that everyone put this on their \u201cto read\u201d pile for 2016. There are just so many interesting aspects to this story-from the strong characters to the intricate descriptions of art to a mystery of an art fraud. New Vessel Press has quickly become one of my favorite independent presses and with THE LAST WEYNFELDT they have chosen another fantastic book to bring us in translation.\n', u"\n           \n           I'm giving this one three stars, although I wouldn't quibble with another reader who might give it four. Adrian was a likable enough main character, but I never felt I was invested in him, as they say. To be honest, the secondary characters held my attention more than the plot itself. Strongest part of the book as far as I was concerned was the Zurich setting, a place I've never been. Glad I read it, and would encourage my Goodreads friends to give it a try if they think it sounds interesting.\n         ", u'\n           \n           4.5*Novel set in ZURICH (a perfect gentleman, Swiss-style)Adrian Weynfeldt is the last person in his family line. He has inherited a superb apartment which has been in his family for many years, with top of the range facilities, views and everything one would expect in a luxury apartment, with full access to wealth and opportunity. He is in his mid 50s, very much a traditional man, signet ring on his finger, a Kennedy hairstyle, tailored suits, regular get togethers with his contemporaries and friends of his parents\u2019 generation, all-in-all rather buttoned-up. He is, in other words, the perfect gentleman, Swiss-style.He is a trained art historian and now buys and sells works of art for an international auction house. He is surrounded by antiques and works of art, and has built himself a great and reliable reputation. He is based in the heart of Zurich, living out his regulated life amongst the rich. The income from the building in which he lives, let out to banks as it is, brings him in a fair fortune and security, let alone other income streams he has in place.What kind of a story can the author possibly build around such a potentially unprepossessing main character?Enter Lorena who is teetering off his wrought iron balcony balustrade with an unstable air about her as the book opens. He only met her the night before, but this oftentimes unprincipled whirlwind will undoubtedly undermine his ordered existence. And at some levels he yearns to experience what it might be to feel really alive. Could risk-taking be the answer to nudge him out of the stupor of regimented and luxurious daily life?He has come to this state of being largely because of his up-bringing, safe, financially secure, yet he has suffered profound abandonment issues \u2013 his mother would often threaten to leave and never return, and his former wife died. He has learned to button up his feelings, and express a degree of ambivalence about relationships so as not to get too deeply committed. He maybe couldn\u2019t control the movements of his mother, and the death of his wife but he does begin to understand that he can now exert control over the course that his own life might take. Symbolically he has lived with the bedroom, which his mother inhabited in the last years of her life, a tomb containing her things. One day, almost on a whim he decides to convert the room to a gym. He is gradually learning to look after his own needs.There is discourse in the book, too, about the value of art. What constitutes original artwork? Why is one painting deemed more valuable than another? Much of the story is built around a Vallotton painting which is being put up for auction by one of Weynfeldt\u2019s friends. His friend needs the money to be able to retire to Lake Como and maintain a lavish lifestyle. Loyalty and principles come into conflict, Lorena playing her challenging part.I really enjoyed the dreamlike quality of the story and the foibles of the, at times, lugubrious protagonist, someone so immersed in his rigid culture and tradition that he hasn\u2019t thought about life beyond the next champagne glass of Louis Roederer. It is an addictive read, with a ponderous pace that perfectly reflects the life of this erstwhile careful man. A choice for lovers of European literature.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'22488222', u'New Fitness Guide for Ladies', u' ', u'\n4976413\nChris Core\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4976413.Chris_Core\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'33686171', u'Etica: Utilitarisme, Logica Deontica, Deu Manaments, John Stuart Mill, Paternalisme, Voluntat, Punt Equidistant, Responsabilitat, Consciencia', u' ', u'\n7695769\nFont Wikipedia\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7695769.Font_Wikipedia\n3.92\n13\n0\n', u'2011', u'8', u'4', u'Books LLC, Wiki Series', u"Font: Wikipedia.

This, however, is a book that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any young girl. It follows the new Disney movie very well, and actually improved upon the movie's depth for me after I read it. It has 8 pages, in the center of the book, of fully colored photos from the movie. I wish they would publish this book in a pretty, little hardcopy with a ribbon marker. I am glad my daughter told me it was one of her favorite books to read and asked me to read it. \n         ", u"\n           \n           I was curious as to how disney would approach a live action Cinderella and make more of the story than a reimagining of the animation, I am also quite impatient so I read this. It's a beautiful book for children, not too simple but not too complicated. It has strong interwoven themes of love, strength, courage and believing in yourself. The Cinderella in this telling is a good role model and the prince far more defined than previous incarnations. The step mother is more complex than evil and the step sisters are fun comic relief. I think this is a version I would have like to have read as a child. It bodes well for the movie\n         ", u'\n           \n           Plenty of people are excited about the new live action movie version of Disney\u2019s Cinderella, and so I figured I might as well read the novelisation and see what they\u2019d done with the (admittedly pretty anaemic) romance this time round. The 1950 animated version is entertaining enough, but there\u2019s a lot more time devoted to singing and mice than there is to character development or any of the actually interesting parts of the Cinderella story.There are a lot of people who start worrying every time a new fairy tale movie comes out. They don\u2019t want the story \u201cruined\u201d by a \u201cfeminist agenda\u201d. Now, I find that really offensive and misogynistic, but I also understand people wanting to see the original story without too many changes.And this is exactly what we get here.The movie trailers promised a longer and more meaningful connection between Ella and her prince (Kit in this book). However, those few seconds in the trailer where they meet on horseback in the forest? That\u2019s all there is!The character of the prince IS more fleshed out, but he is off in the palace doing his own thing while Cinderella is busy \u2018having courage and being kind\u2019 while being literature\u2019s greatest doormat.Something about this book I thought was hilarious was that the author had a character using bloody as a swear word. Um\u2026 this is a children\u2019s book!And because it is a children\u2019s book, I won\u2019t even get started on all the incorrect forms of address for royalty. Surely even a Disney author has access to Wikipedia!If you\u2019re expecting an alpha hero in the shape of a prince, you\u2019ll be disappointed. He\u2019s a shy sort of fellow whose plan for ruling the kingdom is not for international alliances (he doesn\u2019t want any!), but to rule with kindness, courage and love. Ho-kay then. That sounds smart!I do really like softer, kinder, less assertive heroines, as backwards as that may sound. I was a very shy thing at Cinderella\u2019s age. However, there\u2019s kind and then there\u2019s THIS! It was a little painful to see what a weak and useless creature Cinderella was \u2013 even more so than in the animated version.This is exactly what you\u2019d expect: a fairy tale movie put on the page. Expect nothing more.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This story was petty good. there was a little more I wish they had included like occupations the mother and daughter did together, a little more on the mother's funeral, chores that Cinderella must do around the house, and perhaps what happened to the Tremaine's after the absence of Cinderella and the marring of her and the prince. The story was wonderfully developed with wonderful language. I especially loved the little notes the fairy god mother snuck in. overall a great book after you watch the movie and get a little more back round and detail. \n         ", u"\n           \n           A great companion to Disney's live action Cinderella movie, this easy to read chapter book is based on the screen play by Chris Weitz. It's a wonderful edition to have. I love it when movie ties make you feel like you're reading the movie brought to life in book form. Also featured in the book, are images from the movie.

Ellen Gowan is a famous dress designer for ladies of high society and one of the very few women in England who owns her own business. But her life wasn't always one of such privilege.The only surviving daughter of a Cambridge scholar-turned village minister and a beautiful woman who was disowned by her family for marrying for love, Ellen had a childhood plentiful in affection, if not in currency and dresses made of fine silks. Tragedy strikes on her thirteenth birthday, when her father dies suddenly, leaving Ellen and her mother penniless and dependent upon the kindness of her mother's estranged family.<br /><br />Life takes Ellen down various roads of opulence and depravity until she lands in the arms of the devilishly handsome Raoul de Valentin, whom she marries. Just when Ellen realizes that she is with child, Raoul abandons her. Determined to survive, she begins her long climb to success, first by toiling at a dress factory, then opening up her own salon in the fashionable Battle Square.<br /><br />The Dressmaker is a romantic odyssey that takes readers into the most luxurious of ballrooms and the most squalid of brothels. It is the sweeping story of a true heroine and her quest to live life fully-to find success, to find love, in an era when such ideas were unheard of for a woman. Brimming with romance, social intrigue and rich, detailed illustrations of Victorian London and its varied inhabitants", u'3153', u'3.63', u'1303', [(u'to-read', 1535), (u'historical-fiction', 111)], [u"\n           \n           Ok, I debated for a while whether or not to get this book... When I read the back of the book it reminded me of stories I had read before that had started with so much promise but in the end disappointed me with a badly put together/completely dissatisfying conclusions. So I ummed and ahhhed for awhile before I finally gave in...First of all, I want to say if the summary blurb at the back of the book mentioning teen pregnancy makes you feel uncomfortable or puts you off reading this book, please reconsider. Especially if you like historical fiction and heroines that come into their own after many soul weary trials and heartaches.The Dressmaker follows the life of Ellen Gowan, a woman that deals with so much bad fortune, tragedy & betrayal from such a young age in this book that you can't help but cheer her on when Ellen finds the strength to pick herself up, brush herself off and follow her dreams. There are many times in this book where the trials that Ellen goes through are sufficiently heartbreaking that my heart goes out to her, especially when she occasionally begins to see a silver lining, only for it to disappear again.Among the cast of characters in this book there is Polly, a maid from her original family home whose destiny seems entwined with Ellen's and who eventually becomes her pillar of strength in hard times. Oriana, her beloved cousin and sister, if not in blood at least in heart, who faces her own personal trials and must find the courage overcome her fears. Raoul de Valentin, a charming rogue with his best interests at heart. And yummy handsome Connor Moncrieff, an unrequited first love from Ellen's youth who is without a doubt the absolute perfect gentleman. Seriously, this guy is what girls dream about.Connor aside, the other bonus to the book was reading the beautiful creations created by Ellen Gowan as she strives to become successful modiste & mantua maker. You almost feel like you know what it would be like to wear a gown made by Madame Gowan.If this was a movie at the cinema I would pay to see it. If it was a TV movie, I would happily sit down and watch it. If it was a Dvd I would buy it straight out. It was a very addictive read. It's rare to find a book that hooks you at the beginning and keeps you snared all the way through to the end. Oh and yes, the ending certainly did not disappoint me, at all.\n", u"\n           \n           This took me a few chapter to get into but when I did, I was swept up into Victorian England. Just to clarify, it isn't a pretty sight. Poverty is something to be truly feared, as the women of this time period well know.I hesitate to call it a story because it trivializes what the author has accomplished. She has created the life of Ellen Gowan during an oppressive time period for women. She intricately weaves aspects into the book to create a believable protagonist who faces the difficulties of class and money within and without society.The book consists of 3 parts; Ellen's latency including her 13th birthday where tragedy strikes, up to age 15. Part II is Ellen's coming of age. Again, not pretty. More death and sorrow, marriage, pregnancy, destitution, lasting friendship, and survival. Part III is Ellen's success story intertwined with the continuation of earlier stories from Parts I and II.What is striking about this book, besides the fact that the author brings a character to life, is the way the story unfolds and shows the reader the real challenges of Victorian England when one is not affluent or cleverly dishonest. This book is Pride and Prejudice if the Bennetts had no money or estate and Mr. Darcy never arrived. Yet for all the grit, this is not a sad tale. Ellen is not a victim even though her circumstances merit the title. She is also not a heroine who unrealistically rises above it all. She is a woman who finds herself despite circumstances beyond her control. She is a woman who discovers lasting friendship from other women who suffer differently than herself. She is a woman who creates happiness.\n", u"\n           \n           I found the style irritating from the very first pages, studded with frequent italics and exclamation points to suit the melodramatic tone. Here's a paragraph of it from the prologue: Ellen Gowan would not cringe and cry in the dark. She would be warm for she had earned the money so to be. Let there be fire! Let there be candles, not one but several! That strident tone is kept throughout. After the prologue we see Ellen, the dressmaker of the title, as a girl on her thirteenth birthday in 1843. Her family is ruined! Ruined! When another teenage boy kisses her in public. And then--it's God's judgment for her sin in allowing it--the church falls down killing her father the vicar at the altar. Because of an earthquake. In England. I searched online and apparently there is a history of small quakes in Britain, but in all of it's recorded history there have only been a total of 12 deaths from them in the entire island. Afterwards Ellen's mother is so prostrate with grief she doesn't speak for days. That's only about 75 pages in.Really, the overwrought plot and writing was hard to take, and I only persisted reading because the author was on a list of recommended writers for historical fiction. I was disappointed that so little of the book was devoted to her rise as a modiste, and the world of Victorian fashion, and her success due more to luck than business acumen. I found this in the end a rather mediocre soap opera and treacly romance.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I thought it was a melodramatic soap opera that would appeal to a teenage girl, as it did indeed appeal to my teenage daughter. I found it predictable. The main character, Ellen, is beautiful, talented and educated, but poor. Her mother came from a rich family and had been kicked out of the family when when she married her poor scholar husband in a case of true love. But tragedy strikes and the poor scholar husband dies in a freak accident. This means going home to the mother's family and hoping for a welcome. Mother's sister, Daisy, welcomes her and her daughter Oriana, Ellen's cousin, is thrilled to have a pal. But not so Daisy's husband. Always a fly in the ointment. Stuff happens and Ellen and her mother, Connie, leave. As it happens, they are given refuge by a dressmaker who has a rake of a son who is soon after Ellen. More stuff happens. I don't want to give everything away, but it does have a happy ever after sort of ending if convenient deaths don't bother you. And the stunningly beautiful and amazingly talented poor girl is a cliche that sets my teeth on edge. It seems a Victorian England peculiarity. \n         ", u'\n           \n           When Ellen Gowan was just a little girl, her father died in a tragic accident. Ellen and her mother, Connie moved in with Ellen\u2019s Aunt and her family. While Ellen\u2019s Aunt and cousin did not mind having Ellen and her mother around; Ellen\u2019s Uncle was a different story. It got to be too much for Ellen and her mother dealing with Ellen\u2019s Uncle\u2019s wrath that they moved out. Years later, Ellen\u2019s mother passes away and Ellen marries the dashing Raoul de Valentin. Ellen gives birth to a daughter. Raoul is displeased and abandons Ellen and his daughter. With no money, Ellen turns to her talent as a skilled dressmaker. Ellenreceives the chance of a lifetime when she is commissioned by the Countess of Hawksmoor to make her a ballgown. Everyone is so jealous of the Countess\u2019 dress that Ellen soon finds herself being requested by the wealthy. Things are looking up for Ellen until Raoul comes back into the picture. Will Ellen finally get her happy ending?The Dressmaker is the first book I have ever read by Mrs. Graeme-Evans. I absolutely fell in love with this book. Already I was recommending it to all my other reader friends. Ellen has the fighter spirit inside of her. No matter how high the odds were stacked against her, she never gave up. All the characters were so intriguing. I was glad to step into this world with Ellen. I admit that I even cried at one point. Which goes to show you how attached I became with the characters and the story. Mrs. Graeme-Evans spins a vivid world of love, loss and survival.

Her wannabe rocker and quarter Incubus boyfriend, Wesley "Link" Lincoln, was driving, and when he comes to, Ridley is nowhere to be found. The only clue is the giant raven emblazoned on the hood of the truck that hit them, which can mean only one thing: Silas Ravenwood is back. And he has Ridley. <br />Determined to find her, Link reunites with old friends John Breed and Liv Durand, his New York bandmates, and the mysterious Lennox Gates-who has his own reasons for tracking down Ridley. Together they travel through the Caster Tunnels and the Deep South to New Orleans, where they uncover the truth about the infamous Ravenwood labs and exactly what Silas has been doing within those walls. By the time Link and his friends reach Ridley, she is no longer the Siren they know and love. She\'s something new. This time, love might not be enough to save them. <br />In this sequel to "Dangerous Creatures," the bestselling spin-off of the #1 "New York Times "bestselling Beautiful Creatures novels, coauthors Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl deliver an intoxicating blend of magic, suspense, and danger. <br />', u'14730', u'3.82', u'2751', [(u'to-read', 1004), (u'currently-reading', 129), (u'young-adult', 107), (u'fantasy', 84), (u'paranormal', 52), (u'series', 50)], [u'\n\n"You see, there are these remarkable things called books. They\'re full of pages and pages of words. Maybe you\'ve heard of them. Or maybe not." \nThere is really enchanting about this book, this spin-off series (and Caster Chronicles, of course), that I constantly loved them after I\'ve finished reading them. Even I noticed something is off, my mind has already (fabricated) a reason and an explanation for that. I don\'t know why. LOL.I love this sequel. It weren\'t perfect or anything but I really enjoyed reading this book. From the plot to the characters, it was all good to me. Even I found the combination of magic and science is super surreal, I don\'t care as long as the story is making sense. Even there\'s no concrete explanation (though oftentimes, I really need an explanation. (I\'m biased, I know)), I\'m ok with it. Yes, the plot has gone crazy again. It\'s being ridiculous and not. But I found it intriguing rather than annoying because oh well, I want to know what will happen to the world again with all the crazies.Dangerous Deception took me to deeper and darker parts of the Caster world. It explored what I don\'t know about that magical world. Its secrets and whatnots. It also filled the void about what happened after the Order has been changed. But most importantly, it showed me who exactly is Ridley Duchannes. And I did understand her well. And it hurts.The excitement and dread is adding up on me now to know what will happen to Link and Ridley and their love story along the way.

I know I haven't been writing reviews lately or reading books and its because I was in a HUGE reading slump. One of the reasons is because I am taking classes and I am under a lot of pressure and another reason was maybe because I was avoiding this book. But even when I want to read, I always remember all the homework or tests that I have to study for. So that's why you haven't seen crazy updates from me. :) I read the Caster Chronicles series and I thought that I really liked it. So I rated it 5 out of 5 stars, but then I realized that I never really enjoyed it. It put me through reading slumps and I felt like the story dragged. In order for you to read this series, you have to read the Caster Chronicles Series. And, this is the second book in the next series, that you read after the Caster Chronicles series. The first book is called Dangerous Creatures. Although I didn't enjoy the Caster Chronicles, this series had my favorite characters from the Caster Chronicles. It had Link and Ridley and they are both my favorite! The first book was amazing and so interesting, but I didn't enjoy this installment to the series. I felt like the story dragged and when things started to get interesting, the book ended. The plot and storyline were really interesting and the writing style was amazing, but this book wasn't meant for me. Every single time I read this, I felt bored and I wanted to grab another book. But I can't do that for some reason... If I start a book, all my attention goes to that one book in particular. I know it's weird but I'm weird... My friends think that when you don't like a book, just stop reading it and read something else. But I don't know why I can't do that. It's a simple thing but I can't manage to do it, so instead, I get into huge reading slumps. I loved all the characters in this series, but the only problem was how much the story dragged. We learn more about the Caster World and Ridley. I grew frustrated by the end of the book because of all the things that happened. I felt bad for Link and Nox but I wish Nox wasn't so selfish and thought about others, other than himself. If you enjoyed the Caster Chronicles series, I highly recommend this series. If you didn't enjoy the Caster Chronicles series, then you should still give this book a try because it is much better. And if you haven't heard about the Caster Chronicles series, you can read it if you want, but I don't recommend it....P.S, I've been watching some shows lately because of my friends and I love them so much! I started watching Once Upon A Time but now I am waiting until the show ends so that all the episodes will be out. Once Upon A Time is amazing and it's something I love because it has fairy-tales and they all have a twist to them. I started watching Lost and now I am almost finished! I'm on Season 6 Episode 13 and I love all the characters and YOU NEED TO WATCH IT! And I started watching anime and I already finished two shows and I LOVE THEM BOTH! One is called My Little Monster and it's really funny. The other one is Ouron Highschool Host Club and I love this one as well. I am currently watching Polar Bear Cafe and I love this one as well. I haven't been watching or reading anything because of all these classes that I'm taking, but you guys should all watch these!\n", u"\nPRE-REVIEW:Everyone thinks Rick Riordan is the ultimate cliff-hanging troll:But after the ending of Dangerous Creatures, I beg to differ.TITLE GUESSAGES:* Dangerous Darkness (obvious, but come on...)* Dangerous Love* Dangerous LightAll wrong.

Between the much more international scope of this adventure (Ripping to Europe, anyone? Even if only for a short while...) and the crazy intensity of the Ridley storyline (at least we finally got that cliffhanger resolved!), this second Dangerous Creatures story was a short but sweet one.Sweet...until the end, that is. I was warned by a fellow reader that the ending would be bad. She didn't tell me it would be sad. And sad it was. Not gonna lie - I teared up quite a lot. It's hard to say which of these two fine writer ladies, Garcia or Stohl, could be more responsible for this one. While not as lethal as the ending of Idols (for which I'm still not inclined to forgive Stohl anytime soon), or as devastating as the ending of Unmarked (oh God, don't remind me), it still continues their trend of giving me the feels something fierce.Okay. Done talking. I'm gonna go hug my dog now. I need it.

I\'ve read the Anne of Green Gables series once before - over twenty years ago. In spite of the amount of time that has elapsed, I clearly recall reading the last book in the series very slowly and thinking to myself, "I will be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore." When I picked up this book a few days ago to re-read it, I found within a few chapters that it was like seeing an old friend. Anne was even more delightful than I recalled, since I now have daughters who share her "scope for imagination," her penchant for large words and her zest for life. Reading about Anne\'s appreciation for life\'s loveliness made me appreciate my daughters and long to live more in-the-moment myself. So, I decided that a book that feels like an old friend after twenty years deserves five stars.Anne Shirley must be one of the most delightful characters ever written, largely because she is far from perfect. She makes mistakes, as we all do, but her mistakes are much funnier than my own feel and she makes me see the value in learning from each of them, laughing at them and moving on. Like my middle daughter, there is no lukewarm with Anne. I love that she approaches life enthusiastically, despite have spent a decade belonging to no one.I also like that Anne talks straightforwardly about wanting, seeking and building friendships. Even now, I am hesitant, awkward and scattershot at building relationships. I may meet someone who seems a kindred spirit, but lack the time or, let\'s be honest, sheer boldness to approach them and seek to build a friendship. We see Anne seek and build relationships not only upon her arrival in Avonlea, but during her time at Queens.One reasons I re-read this book was because two friends recommended it for it\'s fluency in writing dialogue. Unlike Little Women, which I attempted to read for the writing, this book did not disappoint. The dialogue sounds exactly like each character would sound and it flows smoothly from narration to dialogue and back. In fact, I\'m baffled that Little Women routinely makes top 100 lists while Anne of Green Gables is nowhere to be found on the lists of must-read classics. Unlike the Little Women characters who are archetypes rather than three dimensional characters, Anne is a bold a female character who refuses to be categorized. That\'s exactly why I love her and love this book.\n         ', u'\n           \n           "Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely and I am glad to be alive in you."This quote really accurately depicts how Anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character. She\'s stubborn and makes mistakes, but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities.I loved this SO much and I\'m sad I never read it before! I love all the characters and the plot, and it\'s really fun to see Anne grow up through this book. The writing is also really really lovely.I can\'t wait to read the sequels and follow Anne\'s story! This has made it up to my favorite books of all time list, that\'s for sure.REREAD NOTESI didn\'t think I could love this book more but somehow I do?? I AM SO EMOTIONAL.\n         ', u'\n4.5 starsAnne, my lovely, I feel restored. \n"Marilla!" Anne sat down on Marilla\'s gingham lap, took Marilla\'s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla\'s eyes. "I\'m not a bit changed\u2014not really. I\'m only just pruned down and branched out. The real me\u2014back here\u2014is just the same.

I\'ve been wanting to reread these books for probably a decade, and I\'m still (inexplicably) battling my ever present book funk, so I\'m just gonna do it.

See you soon ;)\n', u"\n           \n           I never read Anne's story when I was younger, so when I heard that Rachel McAdams was narrating the first in the series I knew I had to give it a go. I'm a sucker for a celebrity-narrated audiobook (if you haven't checked out Maggie Gyllenhaal's reading of  The Bell Jar, do that now!).It's wonderful to read a story that, for the most part, is extremely uplifting. There's hardly anything truly terrible that happens in this story, and that's quite refreshing. Granted, it is a children's novel and from the early 1900's\u2014so it has that moralistic quality to it wherein each incident Anne undergoes resolves itself with a lesson learned. But it was delightful, and Anne's optimism is contagious. Rachel McAdams also does a great job at encapsulating that attitude; I felt like I could hear her smile.If, like me, you've never given Anne's story a chance, I can highly recommend the audiobook route. And I'm definitely going to continue listening to this series, especially when I'm in need of a pick-me-up.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I'm so glad I've finally read this book!

Instead of taking an entire novel to breach the forbidden lands, confront the servants of the gods, and reclaim his family, Brogan McTyre does all that in the first few chapters. That his quest doesn't end well shouldn't come as a surprise, but just how much damage his intervention causes is staggering.James A. Moore offers up a story where the threat of divine retribution is a foregone conclusion. Having been denied their sacrifice, the gods immediately set about destroying the world, erasing one land after another in a catastrophic torrent of storms, earthquakes, floods, and landslides. All they want is the men who foiled them for a replacement sacrifice, and the servants that were stolen from them. Unfortunately, Brogan and his men aren't about to give themselves up, and the slavers to whom they sold the servants aren't about to give up their high-priced goods.This is a fast-paced, violent, imaginative read with some deep philosophical roots. It's not blatant or heavy-handed, but there are questions of ethics and morality throughout. Good people do horrible things for good reasons, and more than once we're forced to confront the laws of man versus those of the gods. Just about everybody understands why Brogan broached the forbidden lands, and even kings admire him for defending his family. Similarly, not even the doomed family who helps them can blame the two slaves who escape their divine captivity. As unfortunate circumstances lead to difficult choices, however, the story gets rather muddy.The characters here are all well-drawn, carefully constructed individuals with real personalities and genuine motives. Even the servants of the gods are permitted 'human' roles, forcing us to sympathize with both sides of the battle. As for the wraith-like Undying, they are a supernatural horror to be reckoned with, monstrous forces of divine wrath who are fully-fleshed characters on their own. Although we never see fully within their cowls, what we do see, hear, and feel is enough to add a very Cthulhu-like edge to the horror side of fantasy.At this point I have no idea where The Last Sacrifice is headed, or how Moore can possibly resolve all the conflicts without betraying the sacrifices involved . . . and I love it. This is a story that turns the genre story arc on its head, mixes up the motives of heroes and villains, and muddies the waters of divine intervention.

Moore's familiar swagger, pitting mortals against undying, swords against axes, thieves and travelers and mysterious peoples against the backdrop of an ever changing world and massive cities of sin and death and towers and walls and combat that makes you feel every single blow and every single brutal second, The Last Sacrifice is truly a masterpiece of epic fantasy and horror and should be devoured by all fans of both genres. With a premise that's as universally relatable as it is terrifying, Moore sets hero Brogan McTyre to the wheel of pain and watches him grind and dig and claw and scrape with the knowledge that personal loss and personal conviction is the true key to changing the entire world. With a great cast of characters and POV's, The Last Sacrifice excites down to the last chapter and is an impressive start to a new series from this fantasy/horror master.\n         ", u"\n           \n           After reading the seven forges series which I really enjoyed i got the chance or a arc copy of this the first in a new series.

Like other great PKD books, I am left amazed that he was not more popular in his own lifetime. This is a vibrant, well-written narrative full of erudite observations and keen characterization. He was truly a great science fiction writer, one of the greatest, but also transcended the genre as a good writer in any venue.\n', u'\n"Death upsets everyone, makes them do peculiar things; it sets a radiating process of action and emotion going that works its way out, farther and farther, to embrace more people and things."- Philip K. Dick, Martian Time-SlipDickheads of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your minds! Go ahead, read Martian Time-Slip and push yourself to the limit - you are on Mars in the near future among colonies under the umbrella of the United Nations, colonies formed by citizens from such countries as Russia, Israel and the United States. This framework is all the author needs to explore an entire range of very human topics, from the impact of technology on education to the consequences of limited water supply. Since the story is too vintage PKD over-the-top crazy and convoluted for any simple overview or synopsis, allow me instead to highlight a number of the many colorful characters and themes: Jack Bohlen \u2013 An electronics machine repairman living with his wife and son out in the Martian desert, living very much like thousands of middle class suburban families back on earth. All the way to Mars for this? But the real action for Jack is on the inside \u2013 he has to deal with his past schizophrenia. While on a job at his son\u2019s public school he has a flashback of a hallucination when he was in an interview with a personnel manager in California: he could see through the man\u2019s skin to his skeleton where the bones were all connected by copper wire and all his internal organs were plastic and stainless steel. And this only for starters. Jack\u2019s visions and hallucinations become more disturbing - his schizophrenia resurfaces and threatens to destroy his Martian life. Arnie Kott \u2013Blustering, self-absorbed business leader; it\'s as if PKD had a flash of insight into the future and anticipated a well known current-day president with the initials DT from the constant gush of harsh words issuing from his big mouth down to his fat white toes. Dickheads and Dickhead wannabes should most definitely put Martian Time-Slip at the top of their list for this reason alone. As anybody with a shred of aesthetic sense will undoubtedly realize, having someone like Arnie on Mars quickly turns the red planet into a red hell realm. And what ultimately happens to Arnie? PKD couldn\u2019t hold back.Doreen Anderton \u2013 Girlfriend of Arnie who comes to love Jack, a stunningly beautiful redhead who also is the novel\u2019s most intelligent, perceptive, sensitive earthling on Mars. Doreen is particularly attuned to the dynamics of schizophrenia since she had a brother back on earth who suffered from the disorder and subsequently committed suicide. At one point, Doreen draws on her past observations of her schizophrenic brother to warn Jack of his possible psychic collapse unless he takes the necessary steps to stop work on his current project. A lovely young lady with wisdom and compassion - a fabulous combination. Thanks, Phil. Bleakmen \u2013 The tribespeople living as hunter-gatherers on Mars for thousands of years prior to the arrival of anyone from earth. Their lands are stolen, their mystic beliefs ridiculed and their dignity denied. Some are taken on as slavelike cheap labor in homes, others to work deep underground in mines. Enough to send a few shivers up an anthropologist\u2019s spine. However, the more we read, the more we come to appreciate the power and special insights of these Bleakmen. Manfred Steiner - A ten-year-old autistic boy living at Camp Ben-Gurion along with other "anomalous children." Manfred neither speaks nor interacts with others; rather, he lives in his own world of highly accelerated time which enables him to see the future, an ability that makes him a valuable commodity for an enterprising land speculator like Arnie Kott. But how to communicate with Manfred? The more central Manfred becomes to the story, the more the plot warps in dark, eerie and even sinister ways. Teaching Machines \u2013 Kids are taught at public school not by real teachers but teaching machines, lifelike copies, mental capacity included, of the likes of Aristotle, Lincoln, Edison and Twain. There\u2019s even one of \u201cKindly Dad.\u201d Jack resents these machines forcing sheeplike conformity on the children and tells \u201cKindly Dad\u201d as much. One of the more hilarious sections; I reread several times. Camp Ben-Gurion - A special school for "anomalous children," that is, children judged to have physical or mental or antisocial defects. All these defectives on Mars are a major drawback to marketing efforts to get more people to move to the red planet. One of the proposed solutions \u2013 kill off the defectives. Remind you of Nazi Germany? It should. Time Chamber \u2013 A psychotherapist at Camp B-G by the name of Dr. Glaub explains a new Swiss theory about autistic children like Manfred, how such children experience time speeded up and how a chamber is being constructed to slow sights and sounds down for them. Remember this is science fiction and PKD squeezes the possibility of such a chamber for all its worth. More Schizophrenic Visions \u2013 Distortions twist space and time, occasionally replaying time, and we glimpse schizophrenia from the inside with terrifying images of things like huge meat-eating birds in a decaying, rotting, death-filled world. Curiously, such apparitions and phantasms touch on the mystic rituals of the Bleakmen. Highly recommended. After all, you have nothing to lose but your mind. \u201cI\'m not much but I\'m all I have.\u201d\u2015 Philip K. Dick, Martian Time-Slip\n', u"\n\u201cEverything wears out eventually; nothing is permanent. Change is the one constant of life.\u201d \u2015 Philip K. Dick, Martian Time-SlipMartian Time-Slip may not be one of Dick's BEST novels, but it is almost my favorite. There is a huge energy and vitality in it. Dick is painting with his usual themes (loneliness, madness, drugs, pre-cognition, time, artificial intelligence, the other, corporatism, love, etc), but there is nothing usual about what he extracts. The only thing missing from this book is GOD, but Dick will delve into that later in his career. He is starting to flirt with the surface with the mystical practices of the Bleekmen (Martians).I was especially taken with the time he spent on autism and schizophrenia. This book was written in the 60s just as Autism was starting to be distinguished and separated from schizophrenia, (due to some poor phrasing in the 40s). Dick who suffered from his own mental health issues was probably VERY aware of autism since he was deeply curious about mental health. Anyway, he says it best:\u201cPurpose of life is unknown, and hence way to be is hidden from the eyes of living critters. Who can say if perhaps the schizophrenics are not correct? Mister, they take a brave journey. They turn away from mere things, which one may handle and turn to practical use; they turn inward to meaning. There, the black-night-without-bottom lies, the pit. Who can say if they will return? And if so, what will they be like, having glimpsed meaning? I admire them.\u201d\n", u"\n\u201cGubble me more, she said. Gubble gubble me, put your gubbish into me, into my gubbish, you Gubbler. Gubble gubble, I like gubble! Don't stop. Gubble, gubble gubble gubble, gubble!\u201dThat there is some beautiful dialogue from PKD\u2019s wacky 1964 novel Martian Time-Slip. I remember reading this in the 80s but I have practically no memory of the plot. However, I do remember all this \u201cGubble gubble\u201d business very vividly. There is a surreal hallucinatory feeling to it that I will never forget.The title Martian Time-Slip is almost misleading. Yes, there are Martians in this book a,d there is an element of time travelling in the story but essentially the book is more concerned with psychoses, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The sci-fi shenanigan of the story takes a backseat to the focus on various characters\u2019 mental and emotional issues. I know very little about schizophrenia, but this is the interoperation of the condition by the novel\u2019s protagonist Jack Bohlen:\u201cTrue autism, Jack had decided, was in the last analysis an apathy toward public endeavor; it was a private existence carried on as if the individual person were the creator of all value, rather than merely the repository of inherited values.\u201dWhether this is medically accurate or not, it fits in with our poor hero\u2019s sense of isolation after suffering a schizophrenic episode while living on Earth. There is another interpretation by another character in the book, a Dr. Glaub, who theorises that a fundamental disturbance in time-sense is the basis of schizophrenia. This means that\u2014 according to this theory\u2014schizophrenic perceives time at a different rate from the rest of us. Manfred, an autistic/schizophrenic boy in the book, perceives most people as moving in high-speed blurs, practically teleporting from one location to another, and talking high-speed gibberish; hence his sense of isolation from the rest of humanity.The story set in a colonized Mars, but not a realistic Mars as depicted by books like  Red Mars and  The Martian. Mars in this book is habitable, the atmosphere is breathable, there is a severe water shortage but water is available in the legendary Martian canals . Dick was not interested in the terraforming process of Mars to make it livable for humans, he is more interested in Mars as a setting for the characters with mental issues.After listening to Dr. Glaub\u2019s theory, ruthless businessman Arnie Kotts has the notion that a schizophrenic should be able to access information about the future as their distorted perception of time should logically give them precognition ability. Later on, he further extends this notion to cover an ability to alter the past. From these strange notions, Kott put into action to acquire Manfred, the autistic schizophrenic boy and to hire Jack Bohlen to build an environment that will slow down sound and vision input sufficiently to enable communication with Manfred. Things, of course, do not go according to plan.Martian Time-Slip is quintessential 60s PKD, short, strange and surreal; this is how I like my PKD, with reality warping and bending into weird shapes. Dick was no stranger to mental illness and hallucinations, his characters with mental issues tend to be portrayed sympathetically. The book is not in the same league as Dick\u2019s  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep or  Ubik but it is an excellent read and I heartily recommend it.___________________NoteThe Martians in this book are not little green men, they look more like wizened dark-skinned humans.\u201cI'll be darned.\u201d Leo laughed. \u201cSo those are Martians\u2026they look more like aboriginal Negroes, like the African Bushmen.\u201d\n", u'\n           \n           Paranoia, schizophrenia, greed, exploitation, suburban ennui, adultery, real estate scams, small-time businessmen, robot educators, colonization of Mars, distortions of time and reality, gubble, gubble, gubble...Yep, this is another of PKD\'s brilliant explorations of the minds of his characters, themselves extensions of his own explorations of paranoia and reality. And this one takes it careful time establishing the inner lives of its fairly large caste of troubled characters. It doesn\'t kick into vintage PDK mind-bending territory until fairly late in the story, and then it plunges off the deep end, culminating in a bizarre pilgrimage to the Martian version of the aborigines\' Ayers Rock.A good argument could be made that this book is not really SF at all, but instead an examination of modern man\'s internal struggles amid the prosaic struggle to get through our daily lives. The everyday life of frontier housewives on the Martian frontier doesn\'t seem very far from the bored suburban lives of 1950\'s America.It\'s a telling detail that there are native Martians in this world, but they occupy a marginalized role as primitive aboriginals living on the outskirts of the human colonies, hardly worthy of attention. And yet the only character in the story who can communicate with autistic boy Manfred Steiner, whose powers of seeing the future and affecting reality are central to the story, is a highly-educated but bitter Bleekman (aboriginal) named Heliogabalus (apparently a reference to Syro-Roman sun god Elagabalus). Some of his comments are deliciously erudite and droll, and come in stark contrast to the crude, pompous, and utterly self-absorbed union head Arnie Kott.PKD returns again and again to his recurring images of death, entropy, madness and despair, known variously as kipple (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), the Tomb World (UBIK), and now the only worlds uttered by Manfred Steiner, "gubble, gubble". He is a master at pulling the rug out from under his characters\' realities, and the readers\' as well, and plunging us into his own introspective, humorous, ironic, and paranoid vision of the worlds we all inhabit.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'13752762', u'Social History of Chivalry', u'256', u'\n1093662\nFrancis Warre Cornish\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1093662.Francis_Warre_Cornish\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2005', u'6', u'9', u'Routledge', u'The spirit of chivalry entered into all aspects of the Middle Ages.

It's given me an opportunity to share memories of him losing his temper with foreigners on holidays, being rude to my mother's family at Christmas and failing epically during the fathers' race at my prep school. He's also written some stories about me, but can I just say, before you read anything, that I recall being a calm, well-behaved and learned child, not the intellectually subnormal, mal-coordinated dipshit that he paints me as. Nor am I, as he suggests inside, a sex addict, a flasher or a Scientologist.' - Jack<br /><br />'How dare Jack refer to me as elderly! People always tell me how young I look for my age. In this book, I have at last been able to recount the many occasions when I have been let down by my only son. He failed on the stage, the sports field and he even screwed up the interview for his first boarding school by pretending he had mental health issues. Despite being practically illiterate, he tells stories about me, strewn with grammatical errors and peppered with endless exaggerations and lies. I was a kind, doting father, who guided his son through his formative years with love, care and respect.' - Michael<br /><br />'I'm not your only son, what about Barnaby?'<br />'Oh yes, I forgot about Barnaby.'<br /><br />Packed with anecdotes, some embarrassing and indiscreet, many warm and touching, Him &amp; Me is lavishly illustrated with family photographs and Jack's original illustrations.

These are very funny, be it Michael criticising Jack\u2019s command of the English language or Jack\u2019s horror at his father\u2019s inappropriate use of foreign accents.The book clearly shows the differences between the two generations especially as Michael was a mature first father, but even more clearly shows the genuine love and respect between the two who obviously are very close.I loved it and laughed out loud many times although I have to say I love Jack.\n', u"\n           \n           I received this book as a birthday present and it had been languishing on the to read pile for a while. Feeling uninspired with the other books I had picked out from the to read pile I sought this one out and I'm glad I did.Each chapter is written by one of the Whitehall's with the other making the odd derisory comment in the margins. I loved this format and it was great to see the comedic interactions between them both.As I expected this book was very funny, I was caught laughing out loud on too many occasions to remember. A stand out part, which left me with tears of laughter, was the chapter depicting Jack's various attempts to run away from home. I don't want to spoil it here but it is a true work of comedy genius!The love and strength of the relationship between the Messrs Whitehall is evident throughout the book and a delight to read. The photographs that are dotted throughout the book add to the sense of what a happy and loving environment the Whitehall family is. I also loved hearing about Mrs Whitehall who must be a very patient woman :-)A lovely, funny account of how two people grew up together and a light-hearted look into family life.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Listened to in audio format.For those who don't know Jack Whitehall is a stand up comedian, his father Michael is a distinguished agent who represented Nigel Havers and Richard Griffiths from Harry Potter. I don't find Jack Whitehall on his own particularly funny. Jack is obviously from a privileged background and his success is mainly due to his father's agent connections. However I find Michael and Jack's comedy chat show hilarious.In this book we are regaled with stories from Jack's childhood from Jack and Michael's POV. Such as when Jack deliberately sabotaged his interview for the Dragon School and when Michael confronted some thugs outside his house and his dressing gown blew open and he was naked underneath.To be honest If you have ever watched Jack's stand-up performance you will probably have heard these antidotes before. However I loved the performance of the Tory voting, curmudgeonly Michael. The stories are heart warming and I loved the playful arguing and teasing between the pair.This book was not laugh out loud funny but I did enjoy listening.\n         ", u'\n           \n           What a wonderful book. It\'s not long. It\'s not intellectually stimulating. It didn\'t teach me something or make me suspend reality. What it did do, was make me laugh - out loud, scaring the dogs I was looking after.Michael and Jack both write very engagingly and it\'s clear where Jack gets his funny bone from, though Michael is happy to play the straight man for his son. They are clearly very close and have a wonderfully loving relationship, which this book can only have strengthened. As well as the funny anecdotes and cringing honesty, there are also gentler notes. Their mutual sorrow at the recent passing of Jack\'s godfather Richard Griffiths (of Harry Potter and Withnail & I) is palpable and there are rays of genuine love and care (Jack screwing up a senior school interview because he was worried about his dad being in hospital stands out as a real, honest example of a boy who loves his father).Each chapter is written in one voice or the other. However, each of them will make comments in the margins of the other chapters, expressing outrage, annoyance or, in Michael\'s case, a complete misunderstanding of modern slang. And at the end of each chapter, they get three or four points to object, refute, agree or explain their POV. The other gem is Hilary\'s (wife/mother) "10 things I wish to correct about this book" where she finally gets a say.And now I might go and get the audiobook, so I can hear the arguments aloud...\n         '], 0]!!!![u'35585984', u"The Next Valley Over: An Angler's Progress", u' ', u'\n637820\nCharles Gaines\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/637820.Charles_Gaines\n4.09\n158\n10\n', u'2017', u'7', u'25', u'Skyhorse Publishing', u'<strong>Passionate, adventurous, and insightful tales of fishing from waters near and far</strong>', u'149', u'4.14', u'14', [(u'to-read', 129)], [u'\n           \n           Foreward by Terry McDonell:\u201cCharles Gaines is a handsome man\u2026The perfect cast has been his forever and he is a confident man\u2026 [he is] so deeply eccentric and graceful in his fishing life as to pass from time to time in to\u2026\u2018the trance of instinct.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe literature of fishing is flush these days with middle-aged white guys, most of whom are a little too quick to mention the time they enjoyed a drink with Charles Gaines\u2026 They\u2019ve all been to a great lodge somewhere\u2026 but Gaines has been to all of them.\u201d\u201cWith all appropriate respect for Izaak Walton and the great Roderick Haig-Brown, this is the book Merriwether Lewis would have written about fishing if he were a better writer and as good a fisherman as Gaines, which he most certainly was not\u2026 [I]f you fish and read on a level of sophistication above dynamiting gar, Gaines is your man\u2026\u201d \u201cThis is an outlaw book in so many ways.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s trying to teach you something: fishing\u2019s inner game. Study hard.\u201dI\u2019m not sure of McDonell\u2019s goal in writing this foreword, but I should have gone with my first instincts and stopped right there. If Gaines had any say in the publishing of the foreword, and he allowed this brown-nosing, gushing effluent to be written about him, then my worst fears about the man are realized.While reading this book, I couldn\u2019t help but think this was the most self-centered, name-dropping, snobbish book I had ever read. Now, after letting the book sit so I could gather my thoughts and write a rational review, I reread the foreword and realize that I might have been influenced in my first reading by this foreword. This bragging by proxy just put a sour taste in my mouth I couldn\u2019t rid myself of, no matter how much I spit.Things started off with Gaines talking about fishing with his father at a lake his father owned in Alabama. Gaines was 15 and they were catching bluegill. He talks about that struggle a father and teenage son can have with each other. But then he starts naming lodges and countries he\u2019s fished. It\u2019s beyond me why he has to mention that he has visited 20+ lodges (he names ten of them) and 11 countries, all in one paragraph, and the next paragraph tells us he has developed a \u201clifetime appreciation\u201d for guides.This tells me that he has an affinity for the \u201cprivileged\u201d aspects of fishing. I\u2019m not sure why, but this living the highlife isn\u2019t something I\u2019m interested in reading about. I guess because those aren\u2019t things I\u2019m interested in doing. So I evaluated myself to see if maybe it was just jealousy, but that\u2019s not it because I\u2019ve never felt the need, or even the slightest inkling, to visit exotic locales, stay in lodges or have a guide. I could probably afford some of that, so it\u2019s not because I lack the means, just the interest.The book is written for a different audience than the one I represent.Part of the reason for so many lodges and guides is Gaines had an early desire to fish \u201cthe next valley over\u201d as the nomadic wanderer. What was he searching for in that next valley? \u201c\u2026 it was really dreams I was after. My dreams then all had big fish in them. They had me solving difficult angling problems and beating odds on far-off waters, and living the life of Riley while I was at it.\u201dSo, there it is in a nutshell\u2014\u201cliving the life of Riley.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where Gaines\u2019 money comes from, but apparently he is well-off enough to spend his time in pursuit of fish. Sometimes this comes across as arrogance. With a guide in a drift boat on the Bighorn River he complains, \u201cThe river is covered upstream and down with drift boats\u2026 Among them, moreover, is a flotilla of ten to fifteen little single-man pontoon boats, horrible little sky-blue, high-tech cheapos that belong in a pond at Disneyland with kids in them fishing and hollering and drifting inexpertly all over AJ\u2019s [the guide] precious Bighorn.\u201dApparently only expensive boats with \u201cexperts\u201d in them should be on \u201cAJ\u2019s rivers.\u201d The poor man who can\u2019t have afford a drift boat can\u2019t be on the river and enjoy the same fishing opportunities. And apparently only those on pontoon boats holler and are inexpert.But he wants it both ways\u2014he wants his affluent lifestyle, but he wants us to think he is the common man:\u201cOn the bank we drink a tin cup or two of bourbon\u2026\u201d p 28\u201cWe pour some whisky into tin cups\u2026\u201d p. 32\u201c\u2026 drink vino tinto out of tin cups\u2026\u201d p 42. Sometimes I got the feeling that he was trying to out machismo Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway.Another thing from the quote is that he likes \u201cbig fish\u201d and to \u201cbeat odds,\u201d which means he likes to compete. He\u2019s about numbers. Many fisherman are. I\u2019m not interested in big fish. So this was a problem for me as well. He also fishes a lot of saltwater. Again, I\u2019m not interested in saltwater species.Gaines admits to being obsessed with fishing in his 30s to an unhealthy degree, sacrificing most things in pursuit of fish, including his marriage. He writes of his excesses in drink and drugs. By his 50s he begins to mellow, which is noted in the third section of the book, \u201cRound Third.\u201d He \u201ccomes home,\u201d patches things up where necessary, and settles down. Probably the better part of the book for me.Gaines writing style is fine, and delightful in some spots, such as when he says that \u201cFishing is casting a petition into the unknown, and the eternal wonder of it is that almost anything can be down there ready to bite: your heart\u2019s desire; your worst fear; even something big enough to pull you overboard and catch you.\u201dI did like his title piece. The foreword, then too many nods to that feeling of being privileged, and writing with a macho attitude and about topics I\'m not interested in, just didn\'t do it for me. The guy may be a great guy and fun to fish with, but this book just didn\'t do it for me. I didn\'t feel he made the case for his "progress" of the subtitle.I recommend this book to those who like (or like to read about) fishing for big fish with \u201cimportant\u201d people at the best lodges with the best guides.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Charles Gaines goes beyond the world of just fishing in this collection of autobiographical stories and uses the sport as a catlyst for personal discovery and a look into the human psyche. Gaine\'s writing style has such a unique voice and tone that he easily takes the reader from one adventure to the next. However, no mattter how great the action of a story is he still manages to make deeper correlations the human experience . "The Next Valley Over" to Gaines\' is not just the next fishing spot but the next lesson and higher understanding of life.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This is a great read for anyone interested in exotic locales in fishing.

Just in case that bothers you.What's Never Said tells the story of a failed relationship (which we know was doomed from the first chapter) between a poetry grad student, Lila Lerner, and her professor, Daniel Wildman. The narrator alternates between Lerner and Wildman every chapter, offering the reader head-shaking insight into both characters' minds and hearts as their relationship crumbles around them. The story is told out of time, both beginning and ending in the present day. Wildman's poetry has finally found critical acclaim and he hosts a book reading in New York, which Lerner attends. When he does not recognize her, we are sent spiraling down the rabbit hole of their decades old relationship.Shapiro's writing makes What's Never Said difficult to step away from. I don't read a lot of romantic fiction, and I wouldn't consider it a genre that I enjoy, but I had trouble leaving the story alone. Part of this is because Lerner and Wildman were writing and studying poetry together, so it would come up in their conversations frequently. Not a chapter passed without some bit of poetry being recited from one character to another. The terse, image-laden style of poetry bled into Shapiro's prose as well without ever becoming flowery or tedious. She also captures dialogue perfectly, which is an unfortunately rare ability.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. I think the story of bungled love that turns out okay, even if it still stings every once in a while, is one that most people can appreciate. Shapiro does an impressive job of exploring the lies we tell ourselves and others; rhapsodizing the messiness of love, life and friendship; and illuminating both the pains and pleasures of love lost and love retained.\n         ", u'\n           \n           A hilarious novel about the MFA industry.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Years after their doomed love affair, Lila Penn, a beautiful blonde poet from the midwest, decides to attend a reading by her old graduate school professor, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. To her shock, he apparently fails to recognize her, sending her on a journey to the past where she recalls how their student-professor affair began in secrecy and ultimately crashed.With her eye for detail and dialogue, Ms. Shapiro, author of "Five Men Who Broke My Heart" and the NYT bestselling co-author of "the Bosnia List", has created a honest and painful portrait of two ambitious poets who fall in love but fail to connect because of "what\'s never said"- an ironic situation given that it\'s set against the backdrop of a world filled with "words" - academia and publishing. Written with alterating points of view, Ms. Shapiro skillfully depicts the ambivalence and complicated feelings of two flawed human beings who were not ultimately meant for one another. Moving, funny and filled with revealing insights about the literary and publishing worlds, "What\'s Never Said" is a highly enjoyable, must-read novel.\n', u"\n           \n           I LOVED reading this evocative tale about what happens when young love intersects with 'ready to settle' maturity. Shapiro uses juicy details from her own experiences ( as can be discovered from her memoirs, which are excellent resources for writers and those with addictive personalities) and uses her expertise in poetry and critiquing as a backdrop for the plot. It's a haunting example about how 'what's never said' can change the course of multiple lives. As someone who fell in love with someone unreachable, I couldn't put this down! The characters were so well developed and real that I almost googled them. Without giving spoilers, one of the best things about this book is that it's not a predictable; it's like poetry--truth by metaphor.

I'm not quite sure what to think about it to be honest with you. I can say that if you want a nice traditional romantic novel, then this one is probably not for you. This is a story about a young woman who witnessed her father murder her mother, and then the father turned her into a sex slave to keep her quiet about it. After years of this sexual abuse, she eventually manages to escape by committing a fully justified murder.A stranger takes her in and helps her get back on her feet. An unconventional relationship forms between the two of them, but I would hesitate to call it a romance in the normal sense of the word. It eventually involves paid escorts, girl on girl sex, and a m\xe9nage \xe0 trois. Of course, she also attempts to track down her father to get her revenge on him.

She loves to give her characters a huge urgent practical problem, and then set the most practical among them to solving it. Whether it\'s dramatic or not. She wants to tell you all about how they dug the caves with rock-cutters to make Holds and Weyrs and they had to make the cutters last as long as they could, how they made hypocaust systems using underground heat, how they did this big push to move everything to the northern continent and there was all this vital materiel they had to move and they labeled it in different colors according to its priority, and the dolphins helped carry the smallest packages, how oxen that were reluctant to ford a swollen stream could be pushed along by a dragon flying behind them at exactly the right angle... etc, etc, etc...I know it might sound like I\'m criticizing, but I\'m not. I re-read a whole lot of McCaffrey\'s books recently when my mom gave me a bunch of books she didn\'t want anymore, and this was the one aspect of them that I fell in love with on the re-read. It\'s something I wouldn\'t have appreciated as a teen, which is when I originally read her stuff. But now I live in the country in a place where we do a lot of stuff for ourselves (no stone-cutters, but, y\'know, chainsaws and stuff) and I am finally understanding physical logistics. The focus you snap into when a real necessity presents itself ("OK, we have to make this work, how do we do it?"), and the joy of seeing it done right.So, I like that. I\'m not always crazy about the way she handles characters (the Chosen and the Not--but she doesn\'t do this as much when she\'s busy doing logistics, anyhow!) but I sure do like the logistics.\n         ', u"\n           \n           I really enjoy the Dragonriders of Pern books.

I used to check this out from the library and re-read it all the time. (It didn't entirely hold up, I suppose. I think maybe I was better at filling in the blanks as a kid. I wanted more this time. Loved the Sean/Sorka glimpses!)I don't think I liked the second and third story much, judging by my lack of memory of them! (They were fine on re-read, but still not remarkable to me.)

It makes me wonder how many other words have evolved from acronyms. It\'s also a fascinating account of how the danger the colonists will face was missed \u2014 even in books, people suffer from the accountants! McCaffrey also was a horrible tease, giving me just a taste of what might be causing Thread."The Dolphins\' Bell" recounts the dolphins\', dolphineers\', and sailors\' perspectives on the evacuation of Landing when Garben is getting ready to blow. I loved the interaction of the dolphins with their human counterparts! They love this new game the humans thought up for them."The Ford of Red Hanrahan" is about the establishment of Ruatha Hold and includes the origin of its name as well as the truth behind that "front door". An event that\'s discussed in here triggers the start of the fostering system and the basis for the Harper Hall.There are 500 dragonriders now with Sorka and Sean as the weyrleaders at Fort."The Second Weyr" occurs 28 years after their landing and sees the establishment of Benden Weyr and how dragonriders are sorted out. It also sees the tradition of how a weyrleader is chosen established. It\'s fascinating to read of how they plan this weyr out and decide what will go where. Although, I felt McCaffrey spent too much time on Torene\'s whining on about wanting to grab that bit of land for the weyr. This story sets up the tithing process as well."Rescue Run" is in answer to Ted Tubberman\'s beacon and exploration and experimentation discovers the source of Thread. But it\'s that nasty Stev Kimmer and his "family\'s" beliefs that will leave the rest of the colonists abandoned.It doesn\'t sound as if the spaceships of this time period are all that sophisticated if they have to be so careful about lining up their shuttle with the ship or be left behind. They certainly did a lousy job of exploring the planet. I mean, hullo, if the Kimmer "family" has been reduced to a pre-tech lifestyle, how would young Benden expect to get radio signals from any survivors? Nor can I believe that Benden and crew could possibly not consider the possibility that Kimmer and company are smuggling more aboard on their persons. I mean, duhhh.

This is my first book from her (I'm currently reading another one) and it was a real doozy. \n Life started the night we met. Everything before this was merely preparation for what was yet to come.\nEliza Crowley was 18 years old and on the verge of entering the convent when she met Nate Grady. The year was 1968. Nate Grady was divorced, and because the Catholic Church doesn't allow divorce, Eliza's blossoming relationship with Nate became a point of contention with her family. Despite their objections, Eliza abandoned her dream of being a nun, left the Catholic Church and married Nate. The Night We Met is the story life together, from the moment they met, when they had kids, the problems they encountered throughout their marriage. It reads like a memoir, and it spans four plus decades. It is told entirely in her POV which starts out with a marker of what's going on in the general in the world and then goes on to detail what is happening to their life at that moment. It was very unique and the writing style is very engaging. I was totally invested in Eliza's character and her relationship with Nate. It wasn't an easy one. They went through so much -- births, deaths, infidelity, business triumphs -- the ups and the downs, the ebbs and the flows. It was gut-wrenching and painful to read at times but also satisfying. Yes, there is lots of romance but I wouldn't really consider this as romance because it fits more with general women's fiction. The book doesn't really go into detail or go very deep in examining the characters' motivations but it doesn't mean this was a shallow book. Quite the opposite. Life lessons are dispensed and as a reader, I can't help but connect with what the characters learned at each moment of their lives. Another reason why I hesitate to call this romance was because of the ending. It wasn't a typical HEA but it was very satisfying and it made sense considering the themes explored in this book. This book was really beautifully written. There's some religious undertones but not too much. Nothing off-putting. Just some general stuff about living a blessed life. I for one found it very comforting.A word of caution though, for those who are planning to read this. Tissues. Lots and lots of tissues because there will be tears and snot. Lots of them, so be prepared. \n         ", u'\n           \n           I love Goodreads. I love Goodeads\' reviewers as they are usually so good. However, I just want to say "I hate you" to each and every reviewer that recommended this book, but I guess I can\'t say I wasn\'t warned. You all said it made you cry, and yep. There you go. This link about John Green, author The Fault in Our Stars sums up how I feel about your betrayal.https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbellassa...I don\'t like heart-warming books that make me think of life; I don\'t do dead dog books (Where the Red Fern Grows, Old Yeller, etc. I don\'t do coming of age books as in The Red Pony, The Yearling, A Day No Pigs Would Die.

Tara Taylor Quinn books have that effect on me. In this book the hero and heroine meet, the heroine makes a huge decision in her life that she never regrets and it depicts the heroine and heroes life together as they grow old. I was completely baffled by some of it, at other times it was bittersweet. I have only cried my eyes out in such angst with this author. I hate it, I hated this book for causing me such emotional torment and I hated the author for ending the book on such a sad but hopeful note. But I loved this book, it gave me hope for the future, for love being the thing that gets us all through. I want to say I'll never read another one of this authors book but that would be a lie. She is the most controversial author I have ever known. At times I hate her so much for telling it like it is and at other times I love her for being brave enough to put it into words. Her books are always bittersweet, full of compassion, love and understanding. This book like many others are a joy to read.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Very different sort of writing style/content for a romance. It actually could have fit very well in general women\'s fiction. The story starts when Eliza and Nate meet and tells the story of their marriage over 40 years.

The religiousness in the beginning made me curious at the same time that it disturbed me since I do not prescribe to that way of life at all. Also, reading about the love and dedication Eliza has for her children made me break down and cry about my own childhood. (A true WTF moment for me.) Few people have such good parents and fewer still probably find that kind of love in their lives. Or am I wrong? Is there more love than discord in the world?This book made me think a bit and has really touched my heartstrings.I'm a bit worn out after all that crying though. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'30969873', u'A Deal With a Duke', u' ', u'\n25433\nMary Miller\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25433.Mary_Miller\n3.65\n436\n61\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'<b>A SWEET REGECY ROMANCE</b> <br /><br />In the days of masquerade balls and dance halls filled with pretty women and handsome men, Cynthia Vogel feels somewhat out of place and out of balance.

There is 2 love stories. The main one between Dune and Sophie and the secondary one between Mac and Jenna.We met all the characters in the previous book (No tan lines). Dune and Mac are back to Barefoot Williams for a month vacation, they are best friends and Professional beach volley partners. Sophie is a book worm, tremendously shy and with lots of phobia. One of those being she\u2019s afraid of water. She also doesn\u2019t stand sun so well, so each time she dares to go on the beach she is wearing hat, windbreaker and rubber boots. But this summer she decided it was high time to take some risks and emancipate herself from all her fears. She also has a crush for Dune since she was a kid.Dune is attracted to Sophie and find her absolutely cute, but aware of her shyness he\u2019s hiding his feeling for her. Because of that the romance is quiet slow to kick.Mac and Jenna has a totally opposite relationship. She is as straight forward and sharp tongued as Sophie is shy and sweet, and externally she and Mac can\u2019t stand each other. My favorite character in the book is definitely Mac. He was part of most of the 4 stars moments of the book with or without Jenna. This man produces witty comebacks as naturally as he breaths. The story was sweet but sometimes too sweet for me, thus the 2 stars moments. Another thing that also dragged the story in my opinion is all the "historical" moments. \n', u"\n           \n           DNF at pg 200 - I hate not finishing a book, but I just can't get into this one. There's something odd about the writing style that I'm not connecting with. I can't put my finger on it, saying it's too literal might be the best way, but whatever it is, how it reads, from dialogue to just descriptions, isn't working for me. Also, by page 200 I need to care about the characters and I don't. The heroine is cute enough but I'm not clicking fully with her, the hero or the secondary storyline characters.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Reviewed by JoAnneBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookI love when I find new authors along with new series and Angell and her Barefoot William Beach #2 did not disappoint. The Cates family were an easy bunch to get to know even though there were so many of them; the Saunders not so much. Talk about being born on the wrong side of Center Street vs. with a silver spoon in your mouth.This was mainly the story of the Cates family and how Sophie Saunders connected with all of them. Throughout I loved the give and take between the different family members and friends. I loved the camaraderie, the friendships, the thrill of the chase and the romance, the caring and thoughtfulness shown to others in the family as well as to outsiders being brought into their circle. There was laughter, some tears, happiness and sorrow, fear, acceptance, lots and lots of hot and steamy romance, love and several happily ever afters. Some HEA\u2019s were hoped for and several were very unexpected. I particularly found it heartwarming when Sophie\u2019s mother had an actual conversation with her \u2013 not just telling her what she should or shouldn\u2019t do \u2013 and they seemed to connect. Watching how shy Sophie could draw anyone in and make them comfortable was a rare treat. She was always so caring \u2013 seeing all that went on around her and helping those that needed help without drawing attention to herself or taking credit. Watching first the chemistry and then the love grow between Sophie and Dune as well as Mac and Jenna kept me turning the pages far into the night. There was nice closure tying up all the loose ends.All in all a wonderful introduction to a new author with her books getting added to my always growing TBR pile. I look forward to reading book one in the series and hope there will be others that follow! A great summer read since the story takes place in Florida on the water, the beach and the boardwalk in the fictitious town of Barefoot William! You\u2019ll have to read it to see why the town has such an interesting name!Favorite Quote: \u2018I don\u2019t want safe,\u201d she said, speaking from her heart. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quiet, fearful, invisible Sophie.

Written in 1916, the poems still show a lot of the romantic enthusiasm of the early war years. There\'s plenty of blood, patriotism, and propangandistic lingo here, but there\'s also a lot of understanding of the common soldier. I don\'t know this, but I would imagine his verse would have been popular with a lot of people who wouldn\'t have bothered to read more "serious" poetry. As a kid I loved his Yukon poems (The Cremation of Sam McGee, the Shooting of Dan McGrew, etc) and this is really the same stuff, just transported to the fields of France. Doggerel, but strangely affecting.\n         ', u'\n           \n           This is definitely a book of its time. It is poetry about World War I, back when it was simply the Great War. It was written at a time when poetry was meant to be enjoyable to read, with meter, rhyme, and alliteration making the lines trip off the tongue. Service does this well, but some of his poems use dialect which is difficult to decipher (e.g., "\'ave yer bay\'nit ready"). The themes of the poem deal with war\'s suffering, its glory, its impact on soldiers and survivors. The poems extolling how virtuous it is to go to war sound ironic to my ears, but as I said, it is a book of its time.\n         ', u"\n           \n           I picked up an original of this book at a garage sale of all places, and I fell in love with it.

As a lifelong music fanboy scholar and as a transplant from the midwest to middle Tennessee, this book speaks to my sensibilities on multiple levels. Mark Kemp is a prophet of sorts, because as Southerners and music fans, we need to desperately revisit these issues now more than ever. Recently, I have begun teaching one-day, one-credit classes on topics related to pop culture in our School of Interdisciplinary Studies, and this book is one of my guides for the next installment of that series, looking at race, region, and American music. \n         ', u"\n           \n           I got this book from the library after seeing a youtube video about this subject - I think the book was mentioned in the video credits. I enjoyed the book because I loved the Allman Brothers back when and I still do. I'm happy to say that I saw Duane Allman and Berry Oakley with the group in the summer of 1971. As I had not been aware of this, I loved the way Kemp explained how important the rise of rock music was to the South and integrated his adolescence and early teen years with the cultural (music), social and political changes that were going on then. I was not much of a Lynyrd Skynyrd or Charlie Daniels fan but liked reading about the rise of these early pioneers of Southern rock as well. My interest faded after that when Kemp got into other bands and types of music that I was not familiar with or just was not into very much. I have to say that my interest in rock music waned a lot after the very early 70s, so this is not a criticism of the book itself. So, for me the first part of the book was essentially a long essay on the beginnings of Southern rock that I'm glad I read.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I wanted to like this book more than I do. About half way through I realized it is only about Southern rock. Allmans, Skynyrd, R.E.M. are the focus bands here. The author is from the South, which puts the book a few notches above a music writer with a penchant for detail. I enjoyed the detail connecting the political climates to the culture. I gotta high five the guy\u2026if i wrote a book about music I'd be tempted to include ex-girlfriends into the narrative. I'm not from the South. Across a ten year period I found opportunities to spend long periods of time there. The book doesn't cover how the 90's and oughts college circuit was how a lot of college kids grooved to Lattimore, Bobby Rush, Dash Rip Rock and to a lesser extent, the Hill Country blues of R.L. Burnside, Jessie Mae Hemphill. Chitlin circuit artists aren't here. Like I said, this is about rock music. The author takes a lot of space discussing his own Sherman's march of a writing career. About 3/4 way through the book I skimmed the rest. \n         ", u"\n           \n           I'd read this book before, but I wanted to reread it in light of more current events. The author is just a little bit older than me, so we have the same musical background (I never got into the Allman Brothers, but Lynyrd Skynyrd ruled when I was a teen), and although I'm from Tennessee and he's from North Carolina, there are enough similarities to make the book really hit home. Since it came out in 2004, its analysis of southern music and society ends fifteen years ago; nevertheless, it's a perceptive tour through southern rock in all its permutations until then, showing how the music gave voice to a certain segment of southern society (white teens, mainly). It's not definitive (how could it be?) but it does a good job of explicating the uneasy southern (white) pride based mainly on class, and that has very little to do with race. Still, it's a sad read, because at the end he feels real hope for the future of the south. We now know that it not only was he wrong, but that the south has been revealed as the cesspool of racism and hypocrisy all natives already knew it was.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I begin this review with a confession. I am confessing to being a little biased, since I am just beginning to know the author of this book as a friend. We are both from the same small town of Asheboro, NC and are both fellow authors. It is crazy for me that he begins the book by describing a scene where he is sitting in his all-White elementary school, being told that Black children will be integrated into it. Guess what? Since Mark is two years older than I am, I was one of the Black children to help integrate that school. I was one of the Black children that he was being told would be coming. No one could have told us at the beginning of the 1969-1970 school year that one day we would both wind up writing books and becoming friends. Such a small World. Well, anyways, reading Mark's book was an educational experience for me, because although we are of the same generation and from the same town, I am forced to admit that my musical tastes, growing up, were strictly segregated, meaning that nearly all of the music I listened to was by Black artists. What this book does for me is to take me into the musical minds of some of my White contemporaries, and allow me to \u201csee\u201d and \u201chear\u201d the music they were listening to, and having Mark explain in a profound and meaningful way, what was taken from it, covering its cultural background, and what hopes and ambitions are to be gained from it. It brought me into the world of Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers, and a whole host of others, I truly did not know. I may have heard their music growing up, but I would not have known them to call them by name. This book also makes it clear that for Mark, music is down deep in his DNA, guiding him on a life-long odyssey, opening his mind and spirit to all types of music. I see him using music as a source that benefits him on multiple levels, but I think it's fair to say, that it benefits him most deeply when it resonates within his soul. I'll conclude this with my last statement acting as segue, that is the heart of the matter. Music is at the very soul of Mr. Mark Kemp, and any reader who pays attention while reading this book will have that come out loud and clear. This was an eye-opening, educational, inspirational and deeply moving book, written by a man whose very being is intermingled with, and wrapped up in, music. A great job, this!\n         "], 0]!!!![u'13746568', u"Preaching God's Transforming Justice: A Lectionary Commentary, Year C", u'504', u'\n109608\nRonald J.

The roots of California viniculture and winemaking started on the heels of the 1849 Gold Rush and many of the state's first plantings and wineries date from as early as 1852 in the Los Gatos hills.

After art school I felt like I learned how to make art, but next to nothing about how to have a career as an artist. Of course, unless you wanted to teach at the University level or work at a coffee shop for the rest of your life. This book laid out some very basic things that are helpful in understanding the nuts and bolts of pursuing a career as an artist from graduation to gallery representation. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who has been to art school, and is having a difficult time making sense of why they did that.\n         ', u"\n           \n           As an artist who is about to graduate from grad school and was terrified of what to expect, this book definitely calms the nerves and is a MUST have for any artist - new or someone who has been at it for years. It clears up the processes, gives you good practices, and has overall incredible advice for almost any situation you'll encounter. Best of all, you learn to cover your butt in case something unfortunate happens!

Perhaps it comes from experience, or perhaps I'll never know when I hit the spot and when I don't. I trust my directors, and my boyfriend's valuable advice, and pray that it holds.This book is an intro to the world of Stanislavski's acting technique; all the guidance and fall pits. It's part biography, telling how his system came to be, an introduction to what it is, and the difficulties posed in applying it, due to the many versions and faulty and censored translations.It was ever so natural to study Stanislavski when playing Chekhov, the two walk hand in hand. However, I'm not sure I needed him in this production, but I'm always eager to learn anyhow, so it felt like the right time to pick up this volume. Stanislavski says: \u201cIt is difficult to get into a body which is not one's own size,\u201d but this time, I feel like I've been living the play, like the body I inhabit fits me all too well, like it's my own.Despite how wonderful this production of The Cherry Orchard is, even though it draws towards an end in a few weeks, it feels cursed. I admit, I'm turning into one of those superstitious actors who has to wear those and those underpants to be able to deliver a good performance. But honestly, this project has seemed damned from the start.So, we've picked the promising date Friday, April 13th for our premiere.The play details a summer in the lives of the widow and landowner Ljubov Andreevna Ranevskaya, her family, staff and neighbours, in the last few months they inhabit their beautiful mansion in their beloved cherry orchard. Set in Russia just before the revolution, it shows a point in time where the people are very much in limbo; some can't stop living in the past, dreaming of past happiness or having nightmares of past horrors, others live in the future, either with na\xefve, childish hopes, or ruthless practicality with no concern of people around them, while still others, are completely out of touch with reality. Nobody seems to live in the present. A family is breaking up, and new starts are given everyone, for better or worse, and they all go off on their own way. Firs, the elderly butler, is forgotten inside the shut up and abandoned house, and dies there, alone.We've had two deaths since the production started. First, our director's father, who had been sick for a long time, prompting our instructor to leave us for two months, and postponing the premiere, which was originally in February. Then died the grandmother of the actor who plays Yephikodov, whom he's been very close to, and so he too, was away from the stage for a few weeks.On the upside, we've also had new life. Our Lopakhin has become a first-time father.We've had much illness, and at this point, half the cast, including myself, are sick.What makes me the most sad though, is that some of the cast members are saying this will be their last production, because they're not happy within the group. This time, it was a disappointment for me too, that we're not as close-knit as I have been with casts on other productions, but I do like everyone, and I do know it's worth it, even though I sometimes need to remind myself.I play Varya, the adopted daughter of Ljubov Andreevna. In the course of this production, both she and I have lost our homes against our will, and lost our jobs. Therefore, this play hits a little close to home, and I don't really need any actor's technique to guide me. To contain me, perhaps, when things have gotten a bit too real.The BF, who's been an actor for 26 years now, has a very simple acting philosophy: An actor's job is speaking loudly and clearly. And that's all. That's easy for him to say, he's brilliant.However, he can be made to admit it's not quite that simple. And when he does, he says: \u201cDon't act.\u201dWhat he means is, it's not supposed to look like you're playing a scene, reciting lines; you're supposed to look like this is your life, these are your own words and emotions.Sometimes, he's said to me: \u201cYou were great tonight!\u201d And I've answered that I can't see how that could be, as I had just been talking! I also discussed this with another of my co-actors, explaining that I felt empty inside, doing my scenes on auto-pilot, and he said \u201cit doesn't matter if nothing's going on on the inside, just as long as something's going on on the outside,\u201d and apparently, it was. I suppose it's then that you know it comes naturally, when you don't struggle so hard to conjure up emotion, which will always look fake. If emotion's there naturally, because you can relate to the character, that's enough. Be yourself, not a character. Rule #1: Never ever try to act.One thing I did have some trouble with, is Varya's speeches about entering a convent. In a context with Lopakhin's failed proposals to her, I read the lines sarcastically and bitterly, like the convent was the last resort, as I personally would have viewed it. Then, a few weeks ago, the director goes \u201cno, I want you to say it with bliss, like you want to go on pilgrimage\u201d. I tried and failed several times, until the director went: \u201cOkay, imagine you're saying \u201curban Easter vacation with Magnus\u201d, okay?\u201d, thus substituting it in my head, and making me succeed in saying the line as he wished, applying Stanislavski's principles.I spend a lot of time analyzing my roles. Finding out why my character does what she does, understanding what she wants, what drives her on, what makes her say the things she does. I find it helps me a lot and brings me closer, so I more easily can tap into the person's energy. I think if you're not yourself on stage, you can't be anybody else.But I think too, that indeed an actor's job is merely to speak clearly. The rest is really the director's job, after all. So I think, in principle, that anyone can act, anyone who has really lived and experienced happiness and hardships. Because they can feel empathy.Speak, but don't try to act. That makes for caricatured and flat roles, fit in a comic children's play perhaps, but not for the deeper, more complex character parts. Acting technique can be applied to any role.Just don't act. Don't do it!\n         ", u'\n           \n           A short book that will serve as an informative study of stanislavski, both biographically and his writing legacy. However, most concepts are rushed through and it is a better idea to go through the outdated Hapgood books first to appreciate its faults.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This was a good overview of Stanslavski's life and work. As the back cover of my edition says, it's important to read this book alongside Stanislavski's writings to get the full effect. I was without any of these writings and I was still able to engage with the book, but not in as meaningful a way as I could've if I'd had the supplemental works.This is a great read for anyone interested in learning more about the development of Stanislavski's system and its continuing development in the contemporary world of theatre.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I really liked this book, it provided an insight into the how the 'system' was developed and definitely helped my understanding. It's short and easy to read which makes it ideal for students who want to learn more about Stanislavski and the 'system'.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'27043724', u'Les Grandeurs de La Maternita(c) Chra(c)Tienne', u'432', u'\n4699102\nUnknown\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4699102.Unknown\n3.58\n351220\n11478\n', u'2013', u'5', u'1', u'Hachette Livre Bnf', u'Les grandeurs de la maternitA(c) chrA(c)tienne / par une mA]re<br />Date de l\'A(c)dition originale: 1905<br /><br />Ce livre est la reproduction fidA]le d\'une oeuvre publiA(c)e avant 1920 et fait partie d\'une collection de livres rA(c)imprimA(c)s A la demande A(c)ditA(c)e par Hachette Livre, dans le cadre d\'un partenariat avec la BibliothA]que nationale de France, offrant l\'opportunitA(c) d\'accA(c)der A des ouvrages anciens et souvent rares issus des fonds patrimoniaux de la BnF.<br />Les oeuvres faisant partie de cette collection ont A(c)tA(c) numA(c)risA(c)es par la BnF et sont prA(c)sentes sur Gallica, sa bibliothA]que numA(c)rique.<br /><br />En entreprenant de redonner vie A ces ouvrages au travers d\'une collection de livres rA(c)imprimA(c)s A la demande, nous leur donnons la possibilitA(c) de rencontrer un public A(c)largi et participons A la transmission de connaissances et de savoirs parfois difficilement accessibles.<br />Nous avons cherchA(c) A concilier la reproduction fidA]le d\'un livre ancien A partir de sa version numA(c)risA(c)e avec le souci d\'un confort de lecture optimal.

This book promotes the diverse nature of the study of complex networks by balancing the needs of students from very different backgrounds. It references the most commonly used concepts in network theory, provides examples of their applications in solving practical problems, and clear indications on how to analyse their results. <br />In the first part of the book, students and researchers will discover the quantitative and analytical tools necessary to work with complex networks, including the most basic concepts in network and graph theory, linear and matrix algebra, as well as the physical concepts most frequently used for studying networks. They will also find instruction on some key skills such as how to proof analytic results and how to manipulate empirical network data. The bulk of the text is focused on instructing readers on the most useful tools for modern practitioners of network theory. These include degree distributions, random networks, network fragments, centrality measures, clusters and communities, communicability, and local and global properties of networks. The combination of theory, example and method that are presented in this text, should ready the student to conduct their own analysis of networks with confidence and allow teachers to select appropriate examples and problems to teach this subject in the classroom.<br />', u'13', u'3.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'13784464', u'Robert Kennedy: His Life', u' ', u'\n7112\nEvan Thomas\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1269306859p5/7112.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1269306859p2/7112.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7112.Evan_Thomas\n4.04\n13687\n1102\n', u'2006', u'10', u'15', u'Blackstone Audiobooks', u'Traditionally, Robert F. Kennedy has been viewed as either the "Good Bobby," who saw wrong and tried to right it, or the "Bad Bobby" of countless conspiracy theories, the ruthless and manipulative bully who plotted with the Mafia to kill Castro and lusted after Marilyn Monroe. Evan Thomas\' achievement is to realize RFK as a human being, to bring to life an extraordinarily complex man who was at once kind and cruel, devious and honest, fearful and brave. The portrait that emerges is unvarnished but sympathetic, packed with new details about Kennedy\'s early life and his behind-the-scenes machinations: his involvement in a cheating incident in prep school, his first attempt at romance, and his many back-channel political operations--with new revelations about the 1960 and 1968 presidential campaigns, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his long struggles with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, both of whom were subtly and not-so-subtly trying to blackmail the Kennedys. In a clear and fast-paced narrative, Thomas cuts through the mythology to reveal a character who, though he died young just as he was reaching for ultimate power, remains one of the century\'s most fascinating men.', u'5625', u'4.20', u'2828', [(u'to-read', 2550), (u'biography', 111), (u'currently-reading', 77), (u'history', 61), (u'non-fiction', 57)], [u"\n           \n           Having previously read An Unfinished Life John F. Kennedy 19171963 I have to say it was excellent preparation for this book. If you\u2019re starting from scratch on the Kennedy clan I'd go as far as to say it's essential pre-reading. The JFK bio provides much of the family background missing from this book and also provides the big picture on events impacting Robert Kennedy (RFK) during the period JFK was president. This knowledge helps flesh out the detail provided in this book - it's very much a complimentary piece.RFK\u2019s life is covered in great detail in this book and it does feel like the author played a straight bat (or 'tread a neutral path' for non-cricket followers). There are many positive statements about the man and his achievements, but there are just as many challenges and counter-views.Regarding the man \u2013 his personality and how he differed from and yet complimented JFK - some of the key points I picked up were:- RFK was often an \u2018in your face\u2019 individual in his professional life, challenging to colleagues and frequently rude. Yet he was a family man, tactile and loving to his children. He was attentive and caring when visiting injured soldiers in hospital and rushed to Jackie Kennedy\u2019s side to support her when her first child was still born. He was described at one point as being a \u2018kind boy within a rude man\u2019.- His style was urgent and probing versus the steady and reasonable approach adopted by JFK. These styles complimented each other when they worked closely pre and post JFK\u2019s election. RFK would hector and JFK would tease. They made a great partnership.In examining Robert Kennedy\u2019s career it is evident that he was more adept at running political campaigns and inspiring loyal staff than in shaping long-term policies. Serving as Attorney General in JFK\u2019s government he was also, effectively, JFK\u2019s unofficial number two. He juggled a huge workload. And when the president was assassinated he never really recovered from the personal loss.RFK had two career feuds \u2013 with Hoover (at the FBI), whilst Attorney General supporting his brother, and later with Lyndon B Johnson, when he succeeded his brother as President. It was amazing to read how much time and energy managing these two relationships devoured!Always a physically fearless man, Kennedy took huge personal risks despite known threats to his life resulting from actions against Castro and Organised Crime. In the end it was a mentally unstable drifter who brought his life to a premature end.This is a very well written and exhaustively researched and documented account of an important figure in modern American history. I highly recommend it.\n", u'\n           \n           excerpts from two RFK speeches that never fail to make me shed a tear: "It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance...""Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and to make gentle the life of this world." \n         ', u"\n           \n           The life and times of Robert Kennedy beg for a coherent and in depth book, unfortunately this is not it. Living in the shadow of his presidential brother, the shadow of his oldest brother killed in WWII and the all encompassing shadow of his father, RFK was able to chisel out an identity of his own in US history before his tragic death. Hoping to gain some understanding/insight of/into this man's character and evolution from a sullen child to presidential candidate and everything in between, and a chonology of such things as his involvement in the US civil rights movement, McCarthyism, Cuba (Bay of Pigs and The Missle Crisis) and his relationship in the White House with his brother JFK, I was greatly disappointed. For instance a glaring hole in this book is any serious treatment of RFK and Vietnam. What the book does contain are snippets, quotes and anecdotes, some mildly interesting, (i.e. RFK's role in the release of Martin Luther King from prison), without any cohesiveness and very little context. And although many of the conclusions reached in this volume are valid they are simply not borne out here. The book's attempt to cover significant parallel events is at best confusing and there is also an alarming amount of armchair psychology. I hate to be so hard nosed but the subject deserves much better than this book.\n", u"\n           \n           I think Bobby would have been a good president, better than his brother, largely because Bobby cared. JFK was the life-long politician, whereas Bobby was more the crusading type, a reformer. I think Bobby would really have tried to make life better for the poor, the oppressed, the dispossessed, because he identified so strongly with them. I think he would have been a good president. This is a wonderful biography, very well-written and researched. It really shows Bobby at both his best and his worst - and it breaks my heart that he was killed just as he was really coming into his own, just as he was moving out from his brother's shadow and becoming as his own man, as he'd always wanted to be. His entire life, he'd been second or even third-best, behind his elder brothers, always subsuming his own desires to the will of the family, and even after JFK he believed that the crowds that came to see him weren't for him but 'for Jack'. It's a tragedy that just as he was starting to believe in himself, he was murdered. *sniffles*\n         ", u"\n           \n           I gave this book 4 stars based on my fascination with the content. it was all the more fascinating because I've been reading and watching other material from the same era (e.g. Tom Brokaw's 1968 dvd, Vietnam History Channel dvd's, JFK speeches). Robert Kennedy was a complicated person and played more of a behind-the-scenes role in Washington, working for his brother, doing serious reading and contemplating all his life, becoming a senator for New York. He preferred making phone calls to key people to Get Things Done. And there was nothing black-and-white about him. He would embrace some people and causes he used to criticize. It's a fascinating journey to follow him from ignored, dismissed Middle Child to a courageous, over-achieving family man and devoted husband who operated in the dirty, back-biting world of politics during a decade of social revolution. The book doesn't portray Robert through rose-colored glasses by any means, but I finished with more admiration for him and more disgust for Lyndon Johnson and H Humphrey (Humphrey wrote a letter to Johnson advising him not to escalate our military involvement in Vietnam. Johnson ignored it and shut Humphrey out of all policy discussions. By 1968, Humphrey was campaigning as the only pro-war Democrat.) Many stories about addressing poverty, black civil rights, Martin Luther King and violent confrontations in the south paint an intense picture of life in the USA in the 60s. J Edgar Hoover is another prominent character here. He spent more tax money investigating politicians, securing his own job, than he did fighting crime. He had no interest in investigating The Mob. But he was obsessed with proactively finding dirt on politicians and Martin Luther King. And in the middle of this mess, you have Robert Kennedy reading Shakespeare to get inspiration, struggling to find or light a candle in the darkness, and live up to his father's expectations.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'28936993', u'EAT to WIN: THE ULTIMATE NUTRITIONAL BLUEPRINT TO SPORTS DOMINATION', u' ', u'\n1046598\nRoy Taylor\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1046598.Roy_Taylor\n3.50\n2\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'1', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'34919214', u"The Fly-Fisher's Craft: The Art and History", u' ', u'\n817501\nDarrel Martin\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/817501.Darrel_Martin\n3.82\n17\n0\n', u'2016', u'3', u'15', u'Skyhorse Publishing', u"<b>An illustrated guide to historical and modern flies, hooks, lines, and loop rods.</b><br /><br />Whether looking for a back-to-basics approach to fly-tying or a better understanding of its history, <i>The Fly-Fisher's Craft</i> is the perfect volume to educate the curious angler as well as to provide tips of the trade.

Stieg Larsson is a very weird writer. He likes to tell us absolutely everything someone is doing. If Stieg wrote the story of my morning, it would go like this:"Joel woke up around 7:45 a.m. and looked at the clock. He decided he didn\'t need to get up yet and hit the snooze button. When the alarm sounded again, he dragged himself out of bed and used the toilet. He brushed his teeth and then dressed in a blue striped shirt, black tie and flat front dress slacks he\'d purchased on sale at Kohl\'s. He made himself a cup of coffee, fired up his 13-inch Macbook laptop and checked his email. He had 14 messages. 11 of them were advertisements from various mailing lists or spam emails encouraging him to enlarge his penis. One message was from his mother and two more were shipping notices for books he\'d purchased from Amazon.com. He read the note from his mother but decided to reply later. He then deleted all the messages but the two from Amazon and closed his laptop. He sat on the couch and stared into space, drinking his coffee and thinking."Most writers would probably start the scene several paragraphs later, when I finally get to work (that\'s where the real excitement happens! I check even MORE email!). (Plus it turns out I\'m not even a main character.) But for some reason, this style is, I don\'t know, endearing instead of annoying. I love the way he tells us every time Mikael has a cigarette or what he likes on his sandwiches. And hey, at least I know what brand of cell phone everyone is using.It\'s kind of weird how the series wound up being not at all what I was expecting. Book one was closest, a serial killer story that was nevertheless a weird mash-up of political potboiler and are-the-lambs-screaming-Clarice murder fun. But then book two was mostly about the internal politics of the Swedish police and media industries. And the big climax of the trilogy comes down to an incredibly extended legal thriller, Grisham-style. I assume. I\'ve never read a John Grisham book.But really, everyone knows why the books work, and it\'s because of the characters. Stieg approached the whole trilogy as a sort of manifesto about the injustices heaped upon women in Swedish society, and illustrates them via a host of compelling, level-headed, fairly well-rounded women who are fun to read about even when they spend every other page having sex with the Stieg stand-in. Everyone loves Lisbeth, of course, and this installment does a good job of fleshing out her back story and explaining how exactly one winds up a tattooed, antisocial computer-hacking genius with an insatiable hunger for revenge and Billy\'s pan pizza.This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth\'s story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it\'s number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. I don\'t read legal thrillers but I love courtroom scenes in movies, especially when judges say stuff like "I\'m going to allow it, but you\'d better be going somewhere with this." No one says that here, but only because apparently you can do whatever the fuck you want in a Swedish courtroom without bothering to talk to the judge at all. On the bright side, a flustered prosecutor does break out another old chestnut --"This is highly irregular!" -- that almost makes up for it.So, yeah, I\'m a little sad that Lisbeth has stalked off to that big Ikea-furnished apartment in the sky to join her creator. And I wish Stieg didn\'t eat quite so many of the fatty sandwiches and Billy\'s pan pizzas he loved detailing so much (hey, write what you know). If book 4 never emerges from that mythical laptop, though, this is a pretty good place to end things.\n', u"\n           \n           What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.\tYou can use duct tapes to close up serious wounds; they keep the blood in and the germs out.2.\tYou can be shot in the head and STILL have photographic memory, though annoyingly, you will forget the solution to that pesky Fermat's Theorem that you have just discovered.3.\tCongenital analgesia is a useful condition to have for mafia henchmen and Bond villains.4.\tMuscular, one meter eighty-four tall Latina policewomen who can out-wrestle a man are HOT.5.\tMiddle-aged, out of shape Swedish journalists are powerful chick magnets.6.\tThreesomes and other bedroom antics involving leather, especially if you are stupid enough to record them, WILL come back to haunt you.7.\t\u201cStatistics showed that the absolute majority of people who harassed women were men.\u201d Yes, we know it, that barring a few notable exceptions, most men are SADISTIC PIGS, PERVERTS AND RAPISTS!8.\t\u201dThe majority of poison pen artists were either teenagers or the middle-aged.\u201d Only people between 26 and 54 years of age are crazy enough to become stalkers.9.\tAmazons are cool because they were willing to cut off their right breasts to be better archers. They also liked to copulate with random men to make babies.10.\tMeatballs with potatoes and Lingonberry sauce are good Swedish food.BUT SERIOUSLY,this final book in the Millennium Trilogy is a let down compared to its predecessors. The conspirators who protected Zalachenko and committed Salander into the asylum are revealed early on in the novel, thus removing any sense of mystery. The pair of elderly, terminally ill men who lead them are so out-gunned, out-maneuvered and out-hacked by the good guys from the beginning that there is hardly any suspense left. Salander herself spent the majority of her time on a hospital bed, convalescing from the shot in the head that she received from Zalachenko. The previous books were able to succeed largely because of the peculiar originality of her character and the outrageous stunts that she pulled. With those elements missing, what is left is a rather predictable police procedural filled with tedious bureaucratic wrangling and dull talking heads. The pace picks up a bit with the trial and the novel ends with a sorely needed action piece that provides a closure to Salander\u2019s dark past, but it is nowhere near the level of the exciting episodes that preceded it. Still, if you have read them, you will want to read this one too, if only to get a satisfying ending for Salander, Blomkvist and other characters that we have came to know from the series. My review of \n http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...and\n http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...\n", u"\n           \n           Dear Steig Larsson,I absolutely hate you! But,I think I love you too. While every author has some characteristic quality, yours seem to be aggravate your readers. Ever since I picked up the 1st book of this Millennium saga, I have regretted my decision countless times. You have forced me to bang my head on the wall, pull my hair, throw your books at the end of the room, and then pick it up again and read it like a mad woman, totally forgetting the outside world. So many contradictory feelings have kept me ap at night, and if my predictions are correct I will be thinking about you, this series and your incorrigible characters for at least 2 weeks now. I must commend you for your qualities, though. No one has ever created such impressive and realistic female characters. Lizbeth is always an inspiration, but I think you did an excellent job with all the other characters introduced in this book too. I must also state that you achieved the impossible task of making me like Berger. Indeed, that is a miracle! When you started explaining stuff about her leaving Millennium, I was totally mad at you. I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to Salander\u2019s part. Yet, you went on to create such realistic incidences! Berger\u2019s problems go nowhere near Lizbeth\u2019s, but they seem to be problems right out of real life circumstances. Then you introduce characters like Linder and Giannini, who are in one word amazing. You stun me Larsson, with your spectacular portrayal of women! I am so impressed!now, hold on for minute!Do not get too pleased. You have made life hell for me for the past two months. Do you know how irritating it has been to see this book as a permanent fixture on my bookshelf and currently reading shelf? I mean, what is the point of all the unnecessary yakking? Why the lengthy details? Why introduce characters like Salander\u2019s twin, and that Fegarula person? And why the hell do you add sex scenes that feel so completely out of place in the story. I must also comment on how Mikael's character has become too much of a Mary Sue. Desired by all women? Why is that so? I wonder how much of you is represented through him.:PAlso, I am so glad this saga is at an end. I am glad because I am certain that if there was another book, I would surely have gone ahead and bought it; in spite of my current experience. I am glad that I won\u2019t have to go through all of the emotional drama again, experience all the turmoil, and feel kinship for Salander.I am happy and I am inexplicably sad.This book was clearly not how you planned to end the series. The ending left so much scope for other stories to come after it. I feel very very sorry that there is no more of your work to read and that you will never be able to read this review (not that any author of your standing would). I feel very sad that you died without seeing what a sensation your books became, how the memorable characters you created will forever be etched into the mind of us readers. I am happy that I am ending this year with this series but don\u2019t disillusion yourself with the thought that I would ever reread this series. Happy New Year!Your reluctant fan,Tanu\n         ", u'\n\u201dSalander was afraid of no-one and nothing. She realized that she lacked the necessary imagination--and that was evidence enough that there was something wrong with her brain.\u201d\nNoomi Rapace plays Lisbeth Salander in the excellent Swedish trilogy. She takes the bad girl goth look farther than even Joan Jett.Even if Lisbeth Salander had been raised in a \u201cnormal\u201d environment of a white picket fence, with a swing in the backyard, a dad flipping burgers in a haze of barbecue smoke, and a smiling, sundress wearing mother, she would have been abnormal. As it was she was the daughter of a psychotic, deranged Russian father who lived under a blanket of security because he defected with secrets that the government was interested in knowing. Zalachenko beat Lisbeth\u2019s mother so severely that she sustained brain damage that left her nearly a vegetable. He wasn\u2019t prosecuted. After all she was a whore, just a whore, or so they say, but then \u201ctrusted\u201d government official can leak any information they want and have it lapped up by the media. Lisbeth tried to kill her father.Okay.She tried to kill him twice, but he is a tough old bastard. Let\u2019s just say the environment that Lisbeth was raised in required her to embrace the more abnormal aspects of her personality to survive. So why did she try to kill her father?\u201dThat is under investigation, but there are strong indications that he did indeed attempt to kill her. As far as we can determine at the moment, it was a case of deep antagonism in a tragically dysfunctional family.\u201dThey are related, but they have never been anybody\u2019s concept of a family. She also has a half brother named Niedermann who can\u2019t feel any pain and is a genetic giant of freakish strength.I think everyone knows the story of Stieg Larsson, the author of this trilogy. He died from a heart attack shortly after dropping off the three manuscripts for the Millennium novels with his publisher. It is imperative that readers read these books in order. If you attempted to read this one first, for instance, you would be lacking a lot of critical back story that will definitely heighten your enjoyment of the book. So no short cuts, no cutting to the end, the journey must be taken. You must take the blows along with Lisbeth so her eventual triumph will be your triumph as well. \nShe turned her back and pulled the hospital gown off her shoulder. She sat so that the light from the window fell on her back. He looked at her dragon. It was beautiful and professionally down, a work of art.After a while she turned her head.\u201cSatisfied?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. But it must have hurt like hell.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurt.\u201dThe first book The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a mystery. The second one The Girl Who Played with Fire is a thriller. This one is a courtroom drama. Larsson wrote this trilogy in the evenings for entertainment purposes as an escape from the real world. He was an investigative reporter and I\u2019m sure most of the time real life was too real for him. It was as if he were playing with different writing formats, proving that he could write one as well as another. There are rumors that his girlfriend has a partial fourth book locked up on a laptop computer until the legal issues with Larsson\u2019s estates can be settled. I think Larsson was brimming with stories and had created a heroine, uniquely compelling, with sustainable appeal that would have kept him on the bestseller list for years. I certainly would have been a zombie consumer of Larsson\u2019s books, but I am content with what he gave us. It gives me shivers to think of another author conceiving their version of Salander or trying to mimic Larsson\u2019s version. I do believe that characters should die with their creator. So Salander is in the hospital recovering from wounds sustained near the end of book two. Her father is recovering on the same hallway. They are a mere two doors away from each other. If a hospital could ever be quiet they might have been able to hear each other breathing. Despite the critical condition of their wounds each plots the demise of the other. Each secures a weapon of what is at hand, a pen, a crutch, anything to give them a chance if the other attacks. \u201dOnly a woman who had killed a man in battle was allowed to give up her virginity.\u201dAmazon women, men dream about them. They are not always pleasant dreams. Larsson did sprinkle a few facts about legends of Amazon women between chapters. How fitting, for though our heroine is a scrawny 5\u20191\u201d she is without a doubt a warrior unhindered by compassion and driven to survive. Mikael Blomkvist, the ace reporter, one of the few friends that Salander has in the world whether she wants him or not, is leading the charge for Salander to be released. As he rattles the nerve of the S\xe4po (Swedish Intelligence Agency), in particular the part of the organization called The Section, he discovers a government that has sanctioned too much to protect too little. He has learned a lot about how far they are willing to go to protect themselves and deftly plays a cat and mouse game with them as he prepares his lawyer sister, Anika Giannini, to defend Salander at trial. I\u2019ve noticed that some readers struggled with the investigative part of the novel as we see all the pieces being brought together by teams of people. Some working for Salander\u2019s release and some working to make sure she never sees the light of day. I found it all very real, very interesting as if I were directly involved in the process. The trial is absolutely terrific. For whatever reason Larsson throws in a subplot involving Blomkvist\u2019s long time lover and co-worker Grika Berger. She is being stalked by a someone who obviously has a deep loathing for her. Some of the aspects of this subplot were interesting, but it was totally unnecessary to the overall plot, unless we think of Larsson as a stage manager trying to give one of his favorite actresses a few more lines in the play. Salander has issues with authority, not surprising given how those in authority have routinely decided that she needed to be arrested, locked down in a psych ward, and disappeared altogether. Even without the bizarre circumstances that forced Salander to be an enemy of the state she would have struggled with anyone who wanted to tell her what to do. She could never be the demure little girl in pigtails sucking on a lollipop. She is a lesbian satanist. What? It is hard to tell which one of those words, concocted by her enemies was more alarming to them. She is certainly bi-sexual, uninhibited in sexaul matters. She is a hacker, a woman who can find out anything about anyone. She is nobody\u2019s best friend, but it is better to be her friend than her enemy. As far as Satan is concerned, she would take his pitchfork away and impale him on his own hubris. \nHow to transform yourself into Lisbeth Salander. Black is your only color, your pale skin should never, ever be graced by sunlight, pierce yourself strategically all over your body, have one really cool tattoo, and keep the stone face of a Japanese samurai at all times. Your personality should always bristle with rolling tides of negative energy. Master these aspects and you are ready to intimidate the world. As I read this book I thought about why I, like so many others, find Salander such a compelling character. I\u2019ve certainly never met anyone like her. She is unfriendly, like handling snarled barbed wire. She is instantly suspicious of anyone who offers to help her or any cause that would require commitment. She is a lone wolf, not opposed to giving pleasure, but unwilling to ever say the words that would take a moment of delight to a level of tenderness. She tortures you with silence. She bludgeons you with negative vibes. Her moods swing between tolerable and gloomy. Her smile is like a falling star, rare; and yet, beautiful. There is something wonderful in her ability to fight the odds, to survive, to defeat, to somehow make the right friends that are willing to fight for her when she can\u2019t fight for herself. She does need help, as painful as that is for her, to push past the wall of silent contempt that she erects between her and authority. As it turns out her voice, her story had to be told.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten\n', u"\n           \n           Another short review due to glitches on GR!

Within days, it had started to metamorphose into a structure that would come to symbolise the brutal insanity of the Cold War: the Berlin Wall. A city of almost four million was cut ruthlessly in two, unleashing a potentially catastrophic East-West crisis and plunging the entire world for the first time into the fear of imminent missile-borne apocalypse. This threat would vanish only when the very people the Wall had been built to imprison, breached it on the historic night of 9 November 1989.Frederick Taylor's eagerly awaited new book reveals the strange and chilling story of how the initial barrier system was conceived, then systematically extended, adapted and strengthened over almost thirty years. Patrolled by vicious dogs and by guards on shoot-to-kill orders, the Wall, with its more than 300 towers, became a wired and lethally booby-trapped monument to a world torn apart by fiercely antagonistic ideologies. The Wall had tragic consequences in personal and political terms, affecting the lives of Germans and non-Germans alike in a myriad of cruel, inhuman and occasionally absurd ways. <i>The Berlin Wall</i> is the definitive account of a divided city and its people.", u'2884', u'4.00', u'1127', [(u'to-read', 640), (u'currently-reading', 132), (u'non-fiction', 75), (u'history', 53)], [u"\n           \n           At its best this book is entertaining. At its worst it is over extended, sloppy and a rag-bag of whatever the author felt was interesting with no consistent focus.With 449 pages of text about half actually deals with the Berlin Wall and then only about a six or seven-year period around the wall's construction and then again the last few years down to 1989. The rest is filled up with a run through of Berlin/German history that is irrelevant, patchy and occasionally inaccurate and some general cold war tidbits. But it is easy reading.It's a lazy book. For example Taylor finishes his section on the Khrushchev-Kennedy show down over the Wall by describing it as a defeat for Communism. OK there is nothing wrong in principle in having a simplistic conclusion, particularly in a book that was just a high level history of the cold war looking at the events from the perspective of the Politburo and the Presidency. But it is lazy in a book which just a few pages earlier was taking a more sophisticated 'wag the dog' approach showing how Walter Ulbricht, like Fidel Castro in Cuba, was despite being in the junior position relative to the Soviet Union, was able to create and drive an issue that conformed to his agenda rather than Khruschev's. Maybe I'm simply too critical in expecting a book written by a single author to be internally consistent. Or indeed other eastern Bloc countries were described as relatively more liberal than East Germany, which in the context of one party Stalinist states is an unhelpful choice of words. Would it have taken so long to mention that they practised Goulash Communism - a system geared to providing subsided foodstuffs and basic consumer goods to win the acquiescence of the population?There is a consistent lack of context. Vienna as I remember from The Third Man was also divided among the four occupying powers for a time, but no comparison is made. The author does point out that the Soviets removed German factories and relocated them into Russia but doesn't point out that the British did exactly the same in their sector and that this was a recommendation of the Morgenthau plan. A point arising from this that would have been relevant to his discussion of East German economic weakness was that in the western zones this created something like a blank slate that manufactures could take advantage of, but this effect does not seem to have occurred in the east.The narrative is again effected in his discussion of the fall of the Wall because of a lack of context, here the actions of the Czechoslovak and Hungarian governments come out of the blue despite being part of wider developments tied up with Gorbachev's perestroika impulse, but that in turn was driven by not too dissimilar economic problems to those that beset East Germany. Yes, as Taylor says, East Germany was borrowing heavily from the Capitalist world, but then so were all the other Eastern Block states (actually I'm not sure about Albania, but they were aligned with China anyway). In other words what is presented as a specifically East German problem was in fact a systemic crisis that brought down almost the whole of the Soviet Union and its sphere.For me this is the heart of the problem. A book called the Berlin Wall 1961 to 1989 turns out not to be much about the Berlin Wall.There's just a sketchy introduction to the city existing divided between two states with people living on one side and going to work or school and so on on the other side. The only problem mentioned is with the workers on the U and S-Bahn who were employed by the East and paid in East Marks. Eventually the West Berlin authority agreed to subside those workers who lived in West Berlin to make up the value of their wages. But this situation can hardly have been unique. Life in the East was cheaper and wages in the West were higher. It's hard to imagine that most people didn't take some advantage of this.Generally a city has a unified system of sewerage, waste processing, rubbish removal, utility supply, transportation - what happened to all these once the city was divided by the Wall? There is a mention of U-Bahn tunnels beginning blocked and sewers having stronger grills attached after escape attempts but what about the operation of those systems? Were duplicate systems set up or was there cross border co-operation? Is there really no story here or just an absence of curiosity on the author's part? Is it wrong to expect that the person who is writing a book about a subject should be curious about it? The author mentions that westerners boycotted the S-Bahn during the 60s and 70s but never explains why, let alone why they then stopped (presumably) boycotting it in the 80s. The author doesn't go into any detail about the processing camp for refugees from the East at Marienfelde either. What was it's capacity, how were people debriefed, screened, cared for and moved on, estimates of how many East German spies got through without being weeded out - these are the kinds of things I would have liked to have read about in a book about the Berlin Wall rather than digressions about the Maginot line. Taylor mentions Stasi agents like Guillaume getting through into the West or Stasi agents infiltrating the Western groups that were digging escape tunnels for Easterners - it would have been interesting to read about how this was done. Oh and you know what, since East Germany collapsed and all the Stasi files that weren't destroyed are available to be studied an author can research these things if they can be bothered. What about the enclosure of West Berlin - the text gives a bare couple of mentions to the majority of the length of the Wall which ran round the perimeter of the zones belonging to the Western powers in favour of spending time on the short bit that ran through the middle of the city.Finally when I can spot mistakes in a text, for example the author claims here that the Kaiser abdicated and then a republic was proclaimed when in fact the Republic was proclaimed first and then the Kaiser had no choice but to abdicate, then I wonder how many more there are in the book as a whole.This is a journalistic account of Berlin Wall. There isn't a consistent focus, there is a sense that relevant parts of the story were ignored, and while there is some interesting stuff such as Honecker's trip back to the Saarland, where he had been born, or the tunnels dug under the Wall the lack of context, whether deliberate or out of ignorance on the author's part, means that are inaccuracies among his statements. I couldn't recommend this in good conscience.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Fun to read, but I'm not sure The Wall deserves it's own history. The author uses it as an excuse to tell only selective stories (the most exciting and sexy ones of course) of the Cold War, but these snippets are not really unified by the concept of the Wall itself. He does a good job of explaining why we Westerners were relieved by the Wall's erection and how we continued to love it as a symbol, but this isn't new revisionist work deserving of an entire volume; this story was not one that had to wait to be told, as he claims in the introduction. I would recommend Faust's Metropolis, Ghosts of Berlin, or a good solid Cold War history for real perspective on what The Wall was and is.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Mr. Taylor takes a Noah and the Flood approach to his subject, which is to say he examines the beginning of Germany, the effects of Bismarck, the Emperors Wilhelm, and the aftermath of WWI, before glossing over the rise of Hitler and most of WWII and diving in for a fascinating examination of the foundation of East Germany and the relationship between the leaders of East Germany and the Soviet Union. Particularly vivid and meaningful for me is his recounting of the months leading up to the fall of the Wall, which I remember following in the news (in those pre-Internet days).\n         ', u"\n           \n           I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.\n         ", u"\n           \n           What a tome. I had no idea when I picked this up that it would take me so long, or so much effort, to get through.I have recently become fascinated by the Berlin Wall, mainly thanks to Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther novels. I found it unacceptable that I, a student of history, who had studied the world wars from more than one perspective, and Germany specifically, had never actually known what the Wall was, or how it came to be, or how it came to collapse. It was just one of those things I was conscious of, in a vague way, hearing cultural references to it and nebulously knowing that it had existed, without ever learning more about it.This had to be rectified. It was embarrassing. So when Toby brought home this large and impressive-looking book, I was excited. The trouble with me, and I'm venturing to guess, a lot of others who read this book, is that I read it wanting to know about one specific aspect of the Wall; namely its effect on the people of Berlin. I thought, there are people alive today who grew up 'behind' the wall, who are now living in a capitalist world totally unlike the one they knew as a youth. How have those people come to cope? What was life like for them, and for their families and friends on the other side? Is it a common question in Berlin, or greater Germany today, to ask 'Which side of the Wall were you born on?'Bringing your own baggage to a historical work is never a good idea. Others wanted to hear about daring escape attempts, or the military power of East Germany. I wanted to read about the intimate social issues that came with dividing a city down the middle for forty years. In all cases, we would have found our needs better served elsewhere. This book is a sweeping, overarching history of post-war Berlin, covering politics and politicians in intimate detail. At times it was very like reading for a history class, which was alright for me because I enjoy the sense of achievement gained at having understood a difficult or intricate piece of politics in its historical context. It certainly covers the period of grand escapes, in quite a lot of detail. Often, Taylor will focus on one person whose actions became famous or symbolic at the time, and to me this is where the book shines. Zooming in from the bird's eye vantage point of history, we see the effect on a single person, or a family, or a group of friends, of this monumental act of division. This is why I read this book.I learned a lot. I know a lot more about post-war politics and the shape of the world now than I did a couple of weeks ago. I am a more rounded person for it. But for me there was something missing from Taylor's extremely well-researched book, some kind of humanity that is hard to pin down, that will always be sacrificed on the altar of hindsight and good historical accounts. I missed the sense of pain and life and struggle that would probably have no place in a book of history, and I will continue to search for it in both fiction and non-fiction until I am satisfied.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'30493643', u'Fables of Aesop and Others', u'376', u'\n5158478\nAnonymous\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous\n4.15\n1078031\n56496\n', u'2016', u'4', u'27', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The verses included in the book are:Romans 4:25Romans 5:16Romans 3:23-24Romans 3:28Romans 5:1Romans 5:9Romans 8:30Romans 8:33Romans 10:10Galatians 2:161 Corinthians 6:11The final page of the book contains an age appropriate explanation of the meaning behind the word justification. Parents may want to continue reviewing this page with their children as they are working through the activity book in order to solidify the meaning of the word justification and its relation to the Bible verses they are learning. A few of the possible applications I see for this book are reading scripture to your children, a tool for bible memory, and a Bible-focused art activity. We have been using several of the books in this series as art activities for our younger children. They are very proud to have homework just like their big brothers and sisters, all of whom we are educating at home. What I am most excited about with this series is that it provides a multi-sensory way for my children to interact with God\u2019s word through reading, listening, and physical movement (coloring). My rating for What God Says: God does a Swap is highly recommended.

Terri was born the day her mother died. And ever since then her grandmother, Ollie, has been raising her. At a young age her father left without any warning, causing her to not trust any person outside of her grandma Ollie. Ollie raised Terri to be one of the smartest people she ever knew. Ollie was the typical southern grandmother. Raising her children's children, teaching them the same things they instilled in their own children. But something was different with Terri. Terri graduated summa cum laude from Duke University. And went to grad school at Harvard. Upon her graduation she had several job offers but only one stood out. The one was a five star firm with one female partner and no African-Americans. So she chose it to stand out in more ways than one.But Grandma Ollie knew all this would happen because she could read signs. From a small child she knew there was something different about her, something that separated her from the rest, the 'signs'. That southern 'mumbo jumbo' Northerners always speak of is real down south. Terri's fianc\xe9 Derek is doing just as good if not better than her. They each are powerful in Chicago, have the best jobs, make appearances because of who they are, and compliment each others superiority. And when Terri thought it couldn't reach a peak Derek decided to ask her to marry him and of course Terri said yes. Grandma Ollie feels the urge to call Terri and finds out the news.She then goes to write in her bible the information of the engagement and wedding info. After writing Terri's name there is no ink left for Derek's name..a perfectly good, new pen running dry? No, Grandma Ollie knew that was a sign. So, she tells Terri to watch out for herself and Derek. Well Grandma Ollie is right again. After dropping Derek off for what she thinks to be a 'Democratic National Convention' Terri pulls off in Dereks car and see a brochure and ticket stamp for Cancun, Mexico as well as make-up thats not her shade. She's knows something is up, and that Derek is cheating. But most importantly that Grandma Ollie is right, as always. Terri closes out their joint account and when leaving the bank teller calls Derek. The bank teller turns out to be Derek's mistress. **UPDATE 3/23/13**Due to all the stress Derek has caused on her Terri decides not to talk to Derek or receive his calls for the next couple of days which is the hardest thing since she cannot deny the fact that she loves him. She then receives a call that Grandma Ollie fell and her hip is worse than it was before. She immediately takes off from work and leaves. Before her departure she talks to her assistant who tells her that she shouldn't take a break from her job since she is still uprising and making a name for herself. But Terri knows Grandma Ollie is more important so she dismisses the comments and keeps on going to see her grandmother. When she arrives in Arkansas her grandmother seems fine but thats just her rough and tough outer layer. She's lying in the hospital bed with the same smart mouth she had before Terri left. She doesn't want to be operated on but she has to because her hip will get worse with time. After visiting hours are over Terri's cousin Sugar and her son Cube come and they all go around town looking at what once was Terri's home. Then she passes the old barn, which brings back the memories Grandma Ollie once spoke lightly of. The old barn that burned down years ago. When Terri goes back to the hospital she asks Grandma Ollie about the old barn. The old barn that burned down with the ending of Ollie and her once lover Hank. **UPDATE 3/30/13**The next day Terri goes back to visits Grandma Ollie and asks her to continue the story about the barn that burned down. The story has a huge twist, not only did the barn burn but so did her love for Hank. Hank had stole money from the company he was working for. And at this time it was not good for a black person to steal anything from a white person in the south. So Hank ran to the only place he knew to be safe, the barn. When he reached the barn he decided to hide in it while there were many witnesses. Moments later his bosses came by and saw him so he continued to hide. His bosses decided to burn down the whole barn with Hank in it. Ollie watched from a distance with her father holding her back from running in and chasing her love. When Terri hears this she puts her own love situation into perspective and ends up picking up the phone the next time Derek calls. When he calls she decided to have a sarcastic attitude toward him which shuts him off completely. While crying in the lobby of the hospital (over Derek) a man comes by to make sure she is okay. He sits with her and makes her laugh and offers her a ride home. The man who's name is Lynwood takes a liking for Terri. After she is dropped off Sugar gives her the phone and it is Terri's assistant Hajji who tells her she has a lot of work and problems to fix at the job. Zelda, who slashed all of Terri's tires is putting a company on her back causing her to do more work and possibly lose her job. But Terri fights fire with fire by threatening Zelda with 'trespassing' since she is on camera when she slashed her tires in a private area. \n         ", u'\n           \n           "She\'s got the gift and she\'s got to use it" - that could be Grandma Ollie\'s motto. She has been reading signs all her life and she has never been wrong. So when the pen\'s ink runs dry while attempting to write the name of her granddaughter\'s fianc\xe9 in the family bible, she knows something is wrong...and the drama begins. Yolanda Joe\'s The Hatwearer\'s Lesson focuses on the relationships of and between a countrified, sassy, hat-wearing grandmother (Grandma Ollie) and her ambitious, citified, attorney granddaughter, Terri Mills.Terri and her fianc\xe9, Derek, are a hard working, high profile, no nonsense attorney power couple. Their relationship is what fairytales are made of: they look good together, have great careers, and have the political and social connections to match. But Grandma Ollie\'s prediction comes true and trouble invades paradise on both the romantic and professional fronts. Terri soon finds herself back in the small rural town of Collingswood, Arkansas under the counsel of Grandma Ollie. In a strange turn of events (fate perhaps), Terri\'s life is rearranged with a surprise ending. However, it is not only the Terri-Derek storyline that baits the reader; it is the amorous adventures of a young Grandma Ollie that are equally engaging. It is there where the valuable life lessons are truly revealed and where Terri extracts the wisdom and guidance to make the right decisions regarding Derek and her life.The Hatwearer\'s Lesson is a charming novel full of homespun anecdotes, humor, and wit. Some of the expressions quoted by Grandma Ollie are truly "keepers" and can be retained as priceless bits of practical advice. This is my first Yolanda Joe experience and I am willing to read her other pieces as well as her next release.\n         ', u'\n           \n           When the ink dries out in Grandma\'s Ollie\'s pen before she writes in the name of her granddaughter Terri\'s fiance in her Bible...she knows something is amiss and that her granddaughter is in need of an intervention. Then suddenly Grandma Ollie falls ill and Terri(whom Ollie raised) drops her high-class lawyer lifestyle to rush to Ollie\'s aid and finds herself getting more than she bargained for. As fate would have it, this journey back home to Arkansas has more in store, as Terri has a reevaluation of her heart and spirit, all guided by Ollie\'s advice and life story. From such a cookie-cutter plot (it\'s like Hope Floats, Down In The Delta...you get the gist), The Hatwearer\'s Lesson is a quick and simple read, driven by it\'s colorful characters and is packed with a lot of wisdom, charm, Southern wit, and warmth. What really makes this book is Grandma Ollie and her sage advice. Hence why I gave it an extra star. What a character Ollie is that Yolanda Joe has created! Usually I would cringe at the "sassy-Southern-hat-wearing-grandma" motif because it\'s been there and done that, but Ollie really is something else and you\'ll laugh or nod your head in agreement whenever she speaks. You\'ll also find yourself dog-earring pages or scribbling down a lot of her wisdom---I know I did. I perfectly read this around the holiday season (finished it after the new year)and it was like drinking warm egg nog and having my own quotable-hat-wearing Granny (who has been passed for about a decade now) in attendance who was always telling me something that didn\'t make sense at the time it was spoken---but later on was clear and as precious as crystal.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I often purchase books simply because I life the cover. This is one of those. I give this a 3.5 review. It is a delightful, quick moving love story about a success driven woman who goes south to care for an ailing, hat-wearing grandmother who has a gift for reading signs. Terri think she loves her life and her current man despite his too obvious flaws. She learns differently as she moves through the slow paces of the south and reconnects with family, tradition and simple charms. I like the writers wit and an understanding of Black southern life that reminds me of my childhood. An easy read.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Grandma Ollie has a gift. She has a sixth sense. She raised her Granddaughter, Terri ever since her mother passed giving birth. When Grandma Ollie tries to write Terri's and her Fianc\xe9's name in the old family bible, the ink stops flowing, which gives Grandma pause. Terri moves from the south to Chicago, get's engaged and has to come back home to take care of Grandma Ollie, who broke her hip. Grandma also tells Terri stories of her younger days to give her lessons and to help her make decisions. Acute and funny read.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'32796625', u'Mitolog\xeda universal 4', u'206', u'\n15974298\nMiguel J.

The collection sees the return of some familiar members of the Robertson company, including Strindberg \u2013 heading, as usual, towards calamity \u2013 and the shape-shifter Dionysus. Four loose retellings of stories of the Greek god form pillars for the book, alongside four short Ovid versions. Threaded through these are a series of pieces about the poet\u2019s childhood on the north-east coast, his fascination with the sea and the islands of Scotland. However, the reader will also discover a distinct new note in Robertson\u2019s austere but ravishing poetry: towards the possibility of contentment \u2013 a house, a door, a key \u2013 finding, at last, a \u2018happiness of the hand and heart\u2019. Magisterial in its command and range, indelibly moving and memorable in its speech, Hill of Doors is Robin Robertson\u2019s most powerful book to date.', u'204', u'4.11', u'37', [(u'to-read', 83)], [u'\n           \n           According to Wendy Doniger in The Implied Spider: Politics & Theology in Myth, a dream is a private myth, a myth is a public dream, and poets are the alchemists who are able to render both for us in vivid, visceral ways. Robin Robertson in Hill of Doors, his fifth volume of poetry shows us he is master of both ends of the spectrum. He has already published a translation of Euripides Medea, and this book contains several sketches from Ovid ("The House of Envy," The Ghost of Acteon," "The Cave of Sleep," and "The house of Rumour) as well as several poems exploring the many facets of Dionysus. My favorite, "The God Who Disappears," describes how the infant Dionysus\'s sparagmos generates his multiple and opposing personalities:He spends his life dying. The gods who comes,the god who disappears. Dismembered,he is resurrected. He is beside us; beside himself.Ghost of abandon, and abandoning,he shatters us to make us whole (69).In some ways the "The God Who Disappears" provides a master key for the shattered, multiple selves Robinson explores in the remaining poems, often steeped in dialect of the Scottish highlands from which he comes. Here he is at his best, when he is chasing the shadows of his youth and the sylphs of women down the dark corridors of memory. Many of these have been published in other places: "The Dream House," "Keys to Doors," and "Tillydrone Motte" are wonderful and conjure the landscape of his childhood, and the mindscape of every childhood in spine tingling ways. From Tillydrone Motte:"What I didn\'t know was this: that there would come a time when I would findthe trees unclimbable, the river too fast to ford,that I would learn it wasn\'t a motte at all-this hill where I went to be born-but a Bronze Age burial cairn,and not Tillydron either-this place where I stood my pale cross-but tulach draighionn, which means,and has always meant, \'hill of thorns\'.

Then the Army arrives and Lorna's restricted life expands as she catches the roving eye of a handsome young medical officer.

Set in War times (WWII) in a small village outside of England called Nun Ainsty. Lorna waves her husband off at the train station, he is going to join the war at Aldershot. William is a very stuffy & un-romantic sort of guy and ten years older than Lorna, who is only 23.

It's the type of book my late mother-in-law used to enjoy, especially since it is set in Yorkshire. It's one of those books that's meant to be slow paced. There were times when I felt it was a bit too slow, but I would just have to remind myself that this was just one of those types of books. It's like driving hundreds of miles to see family, you can either take the motorway and not see very much but get there quicker or take the B-roads and enjoy the scenery. This is a B-road type of book and all the better for it. As someone whose parents weren't even born yet by the end of WWII, it was nice to see the war from the point of view of those that had to live through it, something that rarely comes accross in TV dramas and movies set in the period. This book deals well in the realities of life during the war. The main characters are sympathetic and I enjoyed reading about them. However, I felt with the male characters, you could tell that they were written by a female author. Despite that, I did enjoy it and I'm glad I read this book. \n         ", u'\n           \n            The feeling I got, during the early stages of this book, was how the story was going to pan-out.

Right from the start the reader is left with the impression that this is not going to be a \u201cnormal\u201d family holiday with the sister\u2019s, Chelsea and Ronnie, having a less than perfect relationship to the say the least. However as the story progresses we see the relationships between the family members go from strength to strength as the family pulls together to make the holiday as good as it can possibly be and one which, actually, surpasses all of their expectations. I enjoyed this book so so so much and it really did contain so many moments that I could not help but burst out laughing at which, I must admit, led to me attracting some very weird looks from those around me. Although I found Lily to be one of the rudest and most spoilt child characters I have ever come across to date whilst reading a book, by the end of it I fully understood why she might have turned out the way she was. Indeed, I felt that both her and her dad, Adam, became fantastic additions to this book and were blended into the story incredibly well. I also found it interesting to see how I ended up arriving at the same initial conclusions that Ronnie reached about her partner, Mark, and that both Ronnie and Chelsea made about the news their mum, Jacqui, was to share. Incidentally, these conclusions turned out to be entirely wrong but I will say that I found Jacqui\u2019s news to provide a fantastic twist to this book. To talk aesthetics, briefly, I must add how much I really liked the cover of this book which was made to feel like a beach with the towel on a yellow background which actually did look like sand. This being the first Chrissie Manby book that I\u2019ve read in many years I can honestly say that I would ready many more books by her. This was exactly the sort of book I needed to escape from reality and I was so happy to see that a sequel to this book, A Proper Family Christmas, is to be published in November 2014. I honestly cannot wait to read it and see what happens next in the life of the Benson family. It\u2019s definitely something to look forward to! \n         ", u'\n           \n           A great light read packed with interesting characters I felt for.Two sisters, who have fallen out, are reunited on a holiday organised by their parents.

It problematises the framing of African corruption as a phenomenon that emerges from a clash between two sets of norms. Moreover, it highlights the colonial legacies of this frame, which situates African corruption within continually recurring debates about the political inclusion or banishment of 'others'.<br /><br /><br /><br />NGOs are characterised as intermediaries between the local and the international, and between the state and the population. In both of these roles they are understood to reform governance by bringing about changes in culture and instituting bureaucratic norms. They have, therefore, been seen as part of the apparatus of a global liberal governmentality. This book complicates this portrayal and highlights the ambiguous role of liberal governmentality through an exploration of the 'grey practices' of the NGOs studied. These practices are 'grey' as they do not fit the pattern of virtuous NGOs holding the state to account described in development policy, yet at the same time they ensure that the state produces the outcomes that a fully-functioning state ought to. This enacting of oppositional and antagonistic elements is further unpacked in conversation with Homi Bhabha's concepts of negotiation and hybridity.<br /><br /><em>Negotiating Corruption</em> draws attention to both the limitations of current explanations of corruption in Africa and the problematic way in which they are framed. The book's detailed engagement with understandings of corruption within policy and academic debates will make it a useful resource for undergraduate teaching. It will also be of keen interest to researchers, academics, and postgraduate students who engage with the issues of corruption, NGOs, civil society, African politics, governmentality, and hybridity.", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'15825806', u'Racconto azzurro e altre novelle', u'73', u'\n7732\nMarguerite Yourcenar\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1483207978p5/7732.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1483207978p2/7732.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7732.Marguerite_Yourcenar\n4.12\n22916\n1708\n', u'1993', u'5', u'', u'Bompiani', u"Tre racconti pubblicati all'et\xe0 di ventisei anni.

Then on top of the poor choice of topic they muddied the article further by not including any of the specific metrics they used to "study" this phenomenon, no lists of the stores they went to, how they gathered shoppers to query, what types of questions were posed, how many shoppers and stores did they study, during what time of the year, etc. Pathetic.Other fun articles included in this book include one in which the author suggests that the world is now too fragmented to ever get a handle on and marketers shouldn\'t try to target their efforts to specific areas of the market, like say, age brackets or other such piddly demographics. Also there is a super article about how the creative process works which has well over 15 various tables and graphics that each are so condensed and imposing that they resort to using 6 point font in some cases.All of this in a book that was consistently boring and often had glaring grammatical and syntactical errors.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Very academic.

The popularity of these tales, that have lasted for many centuries, and will never be forgotten, is certainly time-tested! They can be read as racy fantasy fiction with appeal for everyone; or as the most thought-provoking epic stories showing up the universal truths searched for by men over ages. The author has carefully reconstructed the diverse versions of the ancient tales with his research efforts over the last 15 years. He seeks to present what they meant to Indians two or three thousand years ago. They are now clearly and concisely integrated with inspired insight, and presented in an attractive, highly readable style with modern flourishes. These classic stories deal with valour, romance, mystery, magic, duty; by reading them we may find out how much they have shaped our minds about the deepest moral issues over thousands of years, spanning national boundaries. The eternal conflicts between the principled Gods and the opportunistic Demons form the main interest. In this book, they effectively come out of our minds and take shapes and desires of their own! The demon-hero Andhak, is the protagonist in the main story. Born blind and ugly, out of his mother\'s impulse and father\'s pain, he is discarded by them for adoption by Hiranyaksh, the demon-king. Andhak is horribly treated by his cousins after his adoptive father\'s death in battle against the Gods. With great effort he overcomes his limitations, and fights the Gods, seeking vengeance... An excerpt follows: Hiranyaksh, the Asura king, was doing severe penances to propitiate Shiva. Such was his prayer: "O Shiva, greatest of Devas, do hear my prayer and grant me this boon! I have no wish for immortality; I do not wish to be any Deva, eternally bound to principles and ideals. I am happy to be just what I am: an Asura, a demon driven by passion and ego, delighting in opulence and fame and revelries. By Your grace, I already possess vast might, large armies, incredible wealth - so much that we are now about to challenge the Devas. "O Shiva, there is no one higher among us Asuras to pray to, than myself. Only to You, the very greatest Deva, the most principled, indeed the very best among Them, most certainly the most powerful - only to You can I pray, for You are the most superior among all entities. From You I beseech a boon. "Shiva, do cast Your favourable eye upon me. Be kind to me. You know that although I am an Asura I am still accessible to Your grace. Forget the squabbles we have to have with the lesser Devas. Those selfish and uncaring hypocrites, aloof and joyless; those moral snobs, pursuing cold and lonely habits; are a natural affront to our senses of equality and gregarious living. They deserve chastisement from time to time. "O Shiva, we Asuras are nothing without passion. Most passionately, I want a son. My brother Hiranyakshap, he has four strong sons. I don\'t want any of them to inherit my kingdom. I want my own son to rule the Asuras. Of all the Asuras, he must be the bravest and the strongest - he must dominate all. All must be in fear and awe of him.

Through this book you can learn some top rate decorating techniques and with a bit of practice you will soon be able to decorate cakes that you previously would only stare at in amazement in a bake store. Just time and practice are you friends.Looking at the recipe and decorating instructions for the Christmas Tree cupcake, for example, you can see how something that looks incredibly complex and intricate is in fact easily achievable by the enthusiastic amateur and creations such as this could make ideal gifts as well as providing a lot of pleasure in your own household. The good thing with cupcakes is that you can easily eat the evidence, should you not be satisfied with your progress to date!For a couple of dollars there is not a lot not to like about this book. It gives you a great introduction into a subject that you might not be familiar with or something you want to dip a "toe" in the water with and try before you invest a lot more in a more comprehensive, possibly in-depth book.

Nothing equals it. <br />Money as a means, made possible the existence of industrial Kings as powerful in civilization as tribal Chiefs under barbarism. <br />Money as a means, stimulates production. <br />Money as a means, has the power to enslave the masses in industrial life. <br />Money as a means, enables us to sustain life. <br />Money as a means, establishes the status of the social life of the individual. <br />Money as a means, determines the destiny of a nation either for woe or weal, for hell or heaven on earth. <br />"An insufficient and improper money is the Root Of All Evil.<br />A sufficient and proper money rightfully used will be the Root Of All Happiness." - Solution, page 99 <br />There are two kinds of money, one is a circulating asset of the government based upon a false standard of value while the other is a circulating liability of the government or banks based upon the standard of an interest bearing indebtedness. <br />I use the word false standard of value because the constitutional gold and silver coins do not and cannot perform that function of a unit whereby the value of all other objects may be determined or brought into mathematical relationship with such unit. The very definition of a standard in its relation to value as given in text books and encyclopaedias preclude such coins from ever coming within the requirements of such definition. <br />Up to this time money based upon a standard of value comprised all kinds of property known to man from the beads of Indians to the gold and silver of the present civilization. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

It is written as a textbook for students and a safe guide for advertisers. Every statement has been weighed. The book is confined to establish fundamentals. If we enter any realms of uncertainty we shall carefully denote them. <br /><br />The present status of advertising is due to many reasons. Much national advertising has long been handled by large organisations known as advertising agencies. Some of these agencies, in their hundreds of campaigns, have tested and compared the thousands of plans and ideas. The results have been watched and recorded, so no lessons have been lost. <br /><br />Such agencies employ a high grade of talent. None but able and experienced men can meet the requirements in national advertising.

He is the inventor of the coupon. He invented the coupon for a reason most people wouldn\'t guess. Claude Hopkins invented the coupon to \'track\' sales. How else would he know which ads were getting responses? How clever! His advice "track everything." Back in the days of newspaper and periodical advertising the cost was expensive. With no free emailing tracking an advertisement was crucial. He was a master at split testing (using more than one offer, tracking results, and finding the winner.) This book was written in the early 1900\'s and the principles are still as fresh today as they were then. Human nature hasn\'t changed. Just because we have more methods to get our messages out with doesn\'t mean the principles have changed. A must read of you are in business, selling, or a stay at home Mom. Everyone needs to understand human psychology, even if it\'s with their spouse at the dinner table or with their kids out at the mall. Thanks Papa Claude!!\n         ', u'\n           \n           As a copywriter, I found that this book is vastly helpful to figure out parameters used in writing a copy that sells. In brief, this is a classic book that never dies out. If you are a creative worker, this book must discipline you in terms of business insights.Several "tested" claims in this book, among other things, are as follows:Minimalism doesn\'t always work. In direct mail, the more you tell the more you sell (chapter 4). Likewise, success stories must be told in complete, either short or long (chapter 8).Copywriter writes on a serious subject; the subject of money spending (chapter 9).Uniqueness is tricky, therefore wise to avoid. Be normal in everything you do when you are seeking confidence and conviction (chapter 9). A project you are sure of may fall down. All because tastes differ. None of us know enough peoples desires to get an average viewpoint (chapter 15).Negative advertising is negative (chapter 18). Similarly, the "Before and after taking" ads are follies of the past. I assume that Hopkins uses sale as a property in this context. This claim is consistent as at the beginning of the book, he writes that an award-winning ad doesn\'t necessarily mean that it\'s good relative to sales. I reckon that a work by DDB, London for Harvey Nichols entitled "What Walk of Shame" (2012) could be an intriguing case study. Regardless thereof, Cannes Lions\' winners are sometimes controversial after all.In general, the contents are properly structured while the titles are effective. Many ideas put forward on this book call attention to a historical figure like David Ogilvy who was also known as a former salesman. If you are familiar with his thinking models, you won\'t have difficulty to follow this book. Several ads are also given as examples. Lamentably, a few of them are illegible (chapter 9). Another weak point, which is substantial, is the absence of data sheet and reference. If it\'s designed to be scientific, why no works are cited? As I read the pdf version which is distributed for free, are these shortcomings also overlooked in the print version? Has the latest version revised them?\n         ', u'\n           \n           Not very scientific. Not a single reference to a real study.

Duly impressed, the ardent youth asked him his name and Tacitus replied that he already knew him from his readings. "Then you must be either Tacitus or Pliny," exclaimed the very excited youth. Pliny (61-113) was absolutely delighted when his friend recounted this incident even though he considered himself a notch below his illustrious contemporary who bequeathed us the "The Annals of Imperial Rome," "Histories," and "Germania."Living in an age that worshipped both the written and spoken word, Pliny considered that there were but three avenues to immortality; military triumph, poetry or history. Honing his skills, he hosted readings of poetry and speeches in both Latin and Greek that lasted for two days. It should come as no surprise that the Roman capital script that calligraphers celebrate to this day as pure perfection, first appeared on Trajan\'s Column in 117 during this age of the glorified word. In search of that immortality, Pliny would publish nine books of his letters during his lifetime, ensuring his fame as one of the first contemporary autobiographers. The most famous tenth book would be published posthumouslyPliny\'s uncle, Pliny the Elder (23-79), died while attempting to rescue a friend during the eruption of Vesuvius. In his will, the author of "Natural Histories" and Roman fleet commander adopted his nephew and bequeathed him the vast estates that would guarantee his rise to the top of the Empire. Beginning at the Bar at eighteen, Pliny the Younger would eventually serve as a Senator and on the Centumviral Court that specialized in inheritance cases. He would also appear in several historic cases tried before the Senate. It is from this rarefied environment that his collected letters and anecdotes give us precious insights into the everyday workings of upper class Rome in the civilized age of Trajan. Even in translation, Pliny\'s letters to his wide variety of imposing friends flow evenly and unblemished with a natural ease and eloquence we seldom see today. In his youth, Pliny sought to emulate and acquire the support of elder statesmen he admired and then in later life, he generously encouraged the advancement of promising youths throughout the civil service and military. He gives advice suggesting tutors and proper spouses, also giving generously from his estates to his home town, promising civil servants and needy friends.Finally, he is appointed Trajan\'s representative to the province of Bithynia and Pontus where he deals with everything from building aqueducts and dams, to complicated issues of citizenship and the cases of soldiers who are discovered to be escaped slaves.It is this posthumous collection of letters to Trajan seeking advice and the Emperor\'s thoughtful responses that insures Pliny\'s immortality. If one only multiplies Pliny\'s requests tenfold, Trajan must have been a very busy man giving thoughtful consideration to hundreds of requests pouring in to him from throughout the empire, constantly referring to the imperial archives in his search for legal precedence.The most important of these letters is, of course, the famous request to the Emperor for a review of Pliny\'s handling of the growing Christian problem that is vexing Bithynia. Tacitus was the first Roman historian to record that Jesus was crucified by Pontus Pilate. One can imagine these two friends discussing this "pernicious superstition," as Tacitus described it, that would eventually engulf their empire. On his way to Bithynia, Pliny stops in Ephesus and one can also wonder if someone there might have mentioned to him that the mother of that curious Christus had lived there until her death some seventy years beforehand.Pliny died on the job in September, 113. I was truly saddened when I turned the page and there was not just one more letter from this exceptional man. He had become a personal friend.\n', u'\n           \n           I\'ll admit that at the time, reading the Letters of Pliny the Younger for my Classics courses was one of my least favorite assignments. Compared to Seneca, Suetonis, and Tacitus, Pliny seemed a bit dry and too run-of-the-mill for my tastes.Looking back, however, the Letters are what remain in my mind the most. The Letters opened the doors to the world of the everyday Roman. In his lively, pompous style, Pliny the Younger painted a vivid picture of the real Rome: the state of the crops, the design of one villa or another, procedural judiciary concerns that arose... In some letters, I can almost hear the emperor Trajan sigh wearily as he takes a moment from his busy schedule to scrawl an "OK" to one of Pliny\'s minor requests. Not many people would appreciate Pliny\'s correspondance. I would say you need interest in Roman society and a healthy dose of curiosity to get through the Letters. But despite this, the Letters are worth their weight in gold, and we are lucky that such precious writings describing an ancient civilization have survived until this day.\n         ', u"\nA look into the life of a Roman aristocrat4 June 2014So we must work at our profession and not make anybody else's idleness an excuse for our own. There is no lack of readers and listeners; it is for us to produce something worth being written and heard.\tA part of me wished that I read these letters a lot closer, and also took some notes, because there are a lot of interesting little bits in here, such as an eyewitness account of the eruption of Vesuvius (letter 6:16), two letters in which Pliny gives a detailed description of his house, a letter that goes into detail with regards to the passion and energy that his uncle Pliny the Elder in relation to his quest for knowledge, and numerous correspondence between Pliny, when he was governor of Bythina, and the Emperor Trajan where he asks various questions regarding specifics in relation to the various laws of the empire and the emperor's decrees, including a letter that is famous among the Christians because Pliny actually asks Trajan whether he is doing the right thing going out hunting down Christians and torturing them (letter 10:96), to which Trajan responds by telling him that while he should arrest and punish Christians when he came across them, he should not to go out specifically hunting them down. Oh, I should also mention that one of the people that he regularly corresponded with was Cornelius Tacitus, and in one particular letter he praises his The Histories, referring to it as a work of immortality (which was then latter stolen by Edward Gibbon).\tAnyway, as I began reading this collection of letters it suddenly struck me that I felt like I was reading Pliny's blog, except that back in those days they didn't have the internet, and while people would read his collection of letters, they could not write comments on them and start an online discussion. Okay, they may be stretching it a bit far, but I have read articles that have suggested that the rise of social media is actually not a new phenomena and that forms of it have existed for centuries. In fact Paul the Apostle was credited as using the concept with his letters because he would write his letter and send it to a church which would then make copies of the letter and forward the copies on to other churches, who would do the same. We see something similar here, not so much with regards to the ancient form of something going viral, but rather somebody taking their private life and making it public, and in these letters we are exposed to Pliny's day to day life.\tHowever to describe these letters as making Pliny's private life public is probably \u2013 no actually is \u2013 a huge misnomer because there was no such thing as a private life in Ancient Rome. In fact everybody lived in an open and public community. The houses were set up in such a way that people in the street could look in and see what was going on inside, and they would be welcome to join in with the festivities. Okay, obviously that did not apply to everybody, but it still very much applied because the house of a Roman was an open house that people could enter and leave at will (though they probably still needed to be home, but the house of the upper middle-class would not necessarily be empty because everybody owned slaves, and even if the householders was not home, the slaves were).\tPliny outlines the reasons as to why he published his letters in the first letter in the collection (and the above link actually takes you to quite a few more as well), were it appears that one of his friends (Septimus Severus) urged him to publish them. We are not told why, namely because we are not actually privy to the original conversation, but maybe it is because Septimus always found Pliny's letters entertaining and engaging. As for me, well, I found them interesting, and a valuable resource to assist us in understanding the nature and the people of this era of Ancient Rome, but as for the content, and the writer himself, well I can't actually say all that much. Actually, if it was not for the fact that these letters reveal to us what life in Ancient Rome was like (at least among the upper classes), I probably would not be interested in them at all. To be honest with you I am not all that interested in reading a collection of emails published in book form by, say, the former governor of Oregon, or some other minor (or even major) politician. In fact I don't particularly care about their private life at all (nor am I really all that interested in their memoirs, though, as I suspect, neither are all that many other people).\tI might just finish off with a comment on book 10, in which Pliny corresponds with Emperor Trajan, asking him numerous questions about the specific rules and regulations that governed the empire. Actually it makes me wonder how many letters Trajan would receive, but then he would probably not actually read these letters, but have a slave read them to him and then dictate the answer (which was what Pliny probably did as well because we know that was how Paul the Apostle wrote his letters). Anyway, these letters give us a glimpse on the particulars in running a province and the questions that the governors would have with regards to the regulations (such as travel passes and the use of the Imperial Post). I also wonder if these letters would be sent to all the governors (sort of like a forum where one person would as a question and the response would be shared among multiple people), though for some reason I doubt it.\t\n         ", u"\n           \n           Des dizaines et des dizaines de lettres \xe9crites par Pline le jeune, le neveu de Pline l'ancien.

Because the text is English and then Latin, which I knew but didn\'t remember, I came to the end unexpectedly, and with unexpected sadness and disappointment. I could happily have kept reading it for another six months if that had been possible.I started reading these letters thinking "Well, it isn\'t Cicero." It isn\'t, and it isn\'t Cicero\'s Rome. But Pliny grew on me, and so did his period. There\'s a whole book of letters to and from Trajan when Pliny was governing Bithynia which were absolutely fascinating. Trajan addresses Pliny as "My dearest Secundus". There are letters to Suetonius and Tacitus, some of them about criticizing each other\'s work. There are letters to Favorinus his wife\'s grandfather, of which the one about his wife\'s miscarriage is the most touching. The politics and recent history are fascinating. As so often with letters, a real sense of the writer\'s personality comes through, and the personalities of his correspondents. Before I read this I\'d read only the most famous of the letters -- the ones about the destruction of Pompeii and persecution of the Christians, and a few others that I\'d done as random Latin unseens long ago. Pliny charmed me on his own merits, and now I\'m glad to have him as a friend.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'32476317', u'Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits: The Ultimate Tips to Apple Cider Vinegar for Weight Loss Success and Other Apple Cider Vinegar Uses with Special Focus on Vinegar Health Benefits Today!', u' ', u'\n14530711\nStephanie Ridd\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14530711.Stephanie_Ridd\n4.00\n1\n0\n', u'2016', u'9', u'27', u'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', u"Vinegar, one of the main constituent of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV), can be termed ordinarily as a sour-tasting liquid containing acidic elements, obtained by fermenting weaken alcoholic liquids, regular wine, cider, or lager. <br />But without any doubt, it is mainly used today in the kitchen as a general cooking ingredient.

New York City was passing her by. Bridges and billboards bearing smiling people were passing her by. Skyscrapers and brownstones were rushing by. Fast. Too fast. Forever.\n3 1/2 stars. Ah, this book was a pleasant surprise. I picked Behold the Dreamers for my September Book of the Month read, mostly because none of the others appealed to me. I hadn\'t any previous plans to read it but, as it happens, it turned out to be an enjoyable read. Full of sadness, hope and - of course - dreamers.It\'s quite an understated book for the most part. Quiet and character-driven. Set just after the economic crisis of 2007/2008, we see the American Dream from two different perspectives - that of Jende Jonga and his family, Cameroonian immigrants desperately trying to obtain a green card and stay in America, and that of the Edwards family, wealthy upper-class New Yorkers who show the cracks in this idea of paradise held by immigrants.The theme is an old one - the fragility of the American Dream - and yet this Cameroonian family breathe new life into it. The author herself is a Cameroonian immigrant living in the United States, and so is able to weave the Jonga family with firsthand insight and honesty; the result being characters that come to life on the page and make you remember them.There\'s an undercurrent of sadness to the whole book. Jende is such a wide-eyed, hopeful dreamer who longs to bring his wife and son to a place he considers a land of opportunity. At a time when animosity towards immigrants has been fostered by the likes of Donald Trump, this book really strikes a chord. The Jonga family are distinctly West-African in their ideals and cultural practices, and yet their desire to give their son the best life possible is a heartbreakingly universal one.All of the characters are treated with such love and care by the author. Members of both the Jonga and Edwards families are multi-layered and sensitively portrayed. Cultural differences and issues of privilege are explored - for example, the Edwards\' oldest son is anti-establishment and longs to abandon law school and head to India, whereas Jende believes the opportunity to become a lawyer is one of the greatest things he could give his son.It\'s a painfully realistic book, as all good books about the "American Dream" tend to be. Sometimes I wanted a bit more from it - a lot of the story and themes of race/culture are revealed through conversations and the plot itself is very... simple. Though perhaps that is a strength too.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store\n', u"\n           \n           This novel resonates with contemporary social and political issues dominating in the US, Europe and Australia, where there is a growing and visceral tide of hatred and rage against immigrants. Imbolo Mbue has written an illuminating book on the immigrant experience amidst the hollowness of the American dream set in New York. The story is told from the perspectives of Jende Jongo, and his wife, Nemi, who are from Cameroon dreaming of a better future in their new home. They have a son, Liomi, for whom they have high hopes. The stage is set for an exploration of their precarious lives buffeted by economic and social forces beyond their control as the 2008 financial collapse is described in terms of its human cost.Jende is working as a cabbie when he lands the dream job of chauffeur to Lehman's executive, Clark Edward, who demands Jende keeps his secrets and give him his absolute loyalty. The two men become close and Clark's wife, Cindy, gives his wife, Nemi, a job as a housekeeper. Cindy confides her thoughts and secrets to Nemi who is hard working and hoping to become a pharmacist. We are given an in depth insight into the laborious and costly process of trying to acquire a green card. The spectacular collapse of Lehman has enormous repercussions on the Edward family. Clark loses his job and the strain on his marriage results in its collapse. Jende and Nemi find themselves with divided loyalties and caught up in the slipstream of these events, and there is a simultaneous similarity as their future comes under threat. We observe the contrasts between a family of privilege and a family with little and the power dynamic in the relationship between the two. We see the yearnings for home, Cameroon, whilst trying to fit into a new home, the eternal immigrant heart caught between two worlds.The novel perhaps underscores the naivete of the dreams of the immigrant given the harsh reality of the world. Mbue touches on the issues of race, culture, violence, pain, and the impact of male decisionmaking on women. The writing is beautiful at times although the characters and plot feel a little uneven on occasion. However, this takes nothing away from a novel that is a timely and pertinent story that carries an authentic picture of an immigrant experience. The characters of Jende and Nemi are complex and captured my interest easily. I loved the portrayal of their home country and their connections with it. A wonderful and insightful book that I recommend highly. Thanks to HarperCollins 4th Estate for an ARC. \n", u'\n           \n           Although the novel takes place in 2008 , even now eight years since then , this is an extremely relevant story given this current political discourse on the immigration issue. Jende Jonga in efforts to get his green card explains to Clark Edwards, in his interview for a job as chauffeur why he wants to be in America: "Everyone wants to come to America, sir. Everyone. To be in this country, sir. To live in this country. Ah! It\'s the greatest thing in the world, Mr.Edwards...Because ...because in my country, sir," Jende said ...for you to become somebody, you have to be born somebody first. You do not come from a family with a name, forget it. That is just how it is, sir. Someone like me, what can I ever become in a country like Cameroon? I came from nothing. No name. No money, my father is a poor man. Cameroon has nothing-"This dream to stay in America for Jende and his wife Neni , a dream to become somebody and have a good life for their children is the center of this story but yet it becomes about a lot more as Jende and Neni\'s future become so tied to Clark Edwards and his wife Cindy. They get pulled into the personal affairs of Clark and Cindy , become their confessors of sorts , telling their inner most feelings and pasts . Yet Jende and Neni have their own burdens, trying to keep from getting deported and having to use some of their savings to help their family in Cameroon. But then the burdens become greater as they are asked by Clark and Cindy to keep their secrets which they must in order to keep their jobs.So much of making their dream come true is dependent on money and so much of their dream is to have money . The timing of the story taking place as Clark\'s employer , Lehman goes bankrupt reflects on a larger scale what people will do for money. There are a number of acts of desperation that happen here, making the characters less than likable even though I felt sorry for their helplessness at times.I learned a good bit about the difficulties of immigrant families and the process of trying to stay in this country. I would like to have seen Jende and Neni\'s story play out without the link to the Lehman bankruptcy. I was surprised at the ending but not sure that it could have gone any other way.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House.\n         ', u'\n"Different things are important to different people."Behold the Dreamers captured me from the very first chapter. I was actually planning on picking this up closer to its release date, but decided at the last minute to just read a line or two to see if it would work in my favor or not. And wow, did it impress for the first half.This tells the tale of a family of three living in Harlem, New York: Jende Jonga, a Cameroonian immigrant, has come to the United States to provide a better life for himself, his wife, Neni, and their six-year-old son.\u201cAs often as she could, she sat in the library to do her homework, or went to office hours to hound professors for advice on what she needed to do to get better grades so she could get into a great pharmacy school. She was going to make herself proud, make Jende proud of his wife, make Liomi proud of his mother. She\u2019d waited too long to become something, and now, at thirty-three, she finally had, or was close enough to having, everything she\u2019s ever wanted in life.\u201dIt\'s really been a while since a book made me think, "just \none\n more chapter." But Imbolo Mbue weaved together such an intricate story that I was left feeling truly attached to this family.I was rooting for Nini whenever we got to read snippets of her studying. I felt truly inspired to start studying myself after finishing the book. And I just have so much admiration for her determination... I think I highlighted one too many parts of this book because of it. (And - fun fact - we both hate the smell of coffee!!)It also discussed the topic of immigration in a really eye-opening way:\u201cListen to me,\u201d Bubakar said, somewhat impatiently. \u201cAs far as Immigration is concerned, there are many things that are illegal and many that are gray, and by \u2018gray\u2019 I mean the things that are illegal but which the government doesn\u2019t want to spend time worrying about. You understand me, abi? My advice to someone like you is to always stay close to the gray area and keep yourself and your family safe. Stay away from any place where you run into police\u2014that\u2019s the advice I give to you and to all the young black men in this country. The police is for the protection of white people, my brother. Maybe black women and black children sometimes, but not black men. Never black men. Black men and police are palm oil and water.\u201dAnd not only immigration, but a lot of topics were handled so well\u2014I felt like the author took everything I didn\'t know how to articulate and put it on paper. And those types of books - the kind that open up your heart and educate you - will stay with me for a long time.But circling back to the plot of this story, Jende can hardly believe his luck when he lands a job as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a senior executive at Lehman Brothers.Everything is seemingly going okay for the Jongas\u2014 Jende\'s immigration court date seems to be years from now, Neni is acing her precalculus finals thanks to the help of her instructor, and Liomi is doing well in his classes.But then the financial world is rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. And Jende and Neni have to stay strong in order to keep their family together.\u201cPlease let\u2019s not think like that,\u201d Neni said. \u201cYou have a job for now, eh? As long as we have Mr. Edwards, we have a job. Are we not better off today than all those people walking out of Lehman? Look at them. I just feel so sorry for them. But then, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the road coming for us, too. We just don\u2019t know. So let\u2019s only be happy that today we were spared.\u201dThey continuously encourage each other to be hopeful, to believe that they would one day realize the dream of becoming Americans. But everything was about to change, one way or another, for everyone in this country.So, as great as those 100-200 first pages were, the ending really, really bothered me. I hated how horrendous Jende\u2019s actions were and was even more appalled when he acted as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. Just...his sudden change of character towards the end didn\u2019t sit well with me.And Neni\u2019s hate towards other girls threw me out of the story as well.\u201cCindy\u2019s things she planned to reserve for special occasions. She would wear them to weddings and anniversaries to show those girls that even though she had returned home and was living among them, she was not one of them\u2014she was now a woman of class, with real designer items, and none of them could compete with her.\u201dOverall, a great introduction to a compelling family, but with a number of problematic behaviours and flaws while unraveling their story.ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.3.5 stars*Note: I\'m an Amazon Affiliate.

One of our presidential candidates is foaming at the mouth about \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for immigrants. But then along comes \u201cBehold the Dreamers,\u201d a debut novel by a young woman from Cameroon that illuminates the immigrant experience in America with the tenderhearted wisdom so lacking in our political discourse. While another author might have played that imperative title sarcastically, for Imbolo Mbue, \u201cBehold the Dreamers\u201d is a kind of angelic annunciation of hope, which ultimately makes her story even more poignant.After a childhood of extreme poverty, Mbue came to this country in 1998 \u2014 recent enough to retain the optimism of an immigrant but long enough to understand our national schizophrenia about foreigners. Her novel is about a family from Cameroon living in Harlem on the eve of striking disruption. The United States is about to elect its first black president and descend into the Great Recession. But Jende Jonga, the hero of this tale, has his mind set on only one thing: becoming a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a hotshot Lehman Brothers executive. Jende and his wife, Neni, have been preparing for the interview for days.

If you\'ve ever had similar thoughts, this is the place to start. This work is long - around 22 hours of Librivox audio - and written in archaic, ornate English. But anyone reading it will be immediately impressed by its scholarship and depth. It also gives a clear picture of what said Founding Fathers were up against - unbridled, often unprincipled, and outright rude opposition to pretty much every last bit of the Constitution at every turn. This series of essays was painstakingly written to try and convince the country that, while the new Constitution was not and could not be perfect, it was urgently needed to get the Union government functional, and that it was perhaps the best that could be done, given an imperfect world and us imperfect humans. The writers of the new Constitution were clearly trying their utmost to create a government and society as fair, conflict-free and well-functioning as they could manage. Interesting how slaves were reluctantly counted, in a compromise with the South, as having 3/5 the personhood of a free-born man. Really, every American, and anybody interested in how power, justice, and societies work, should read this carefully. It\'s left me a little tired, but happy and satisfied.\n         ', u"\n\nWhy has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without restraint.\nLike any educated American who hasn\u2019t already read this book, this classic has long been on my reading list. Nevertheless, even amongst us haughty literati, I suspect that this book is a Mark Twain kind of classic\u2014one that we wish to have read, but don\u2019t look forward to actually reading. It certainly was that way for me. Philistine that I am, the idea of leafing through 500 pages of articles by this country\u2019s founding fathers did not exactly give me goosebumps. I\u2019m afraid that my fears were partially borne out by this book. It was not terribly pleasant. And if I am to be honest, I must shamefacedly admit that I often found these articles dreadfully dull. One obstacle to my reading pleasure simply came from the style of writing. These pieces were written in great haste, over the span of a year, by harried men who were not professional thinkers or writers. As a result, this book can often feel a bit haphazard and disorganized. Several papers seem as though they were dashed off between breakfast and lunch; the arguments tumble forward in a torrential outpouring of frenetic scribbling. The prose, too, was often cramped, bloated, and opaque:The circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments would, of course, have governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate is the body whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President.Another disappointment was simply the method of argumentation. The words \u201cprobably\u201d and \u201clikely\u201d do a great deal of work in these papers. The authors are constantly making light of certain possibilities and boldly predicting others. This rhetorical device is seldom convincing. Who knows what the future will bring? A related technique is to use what Dawkins calls the \u201cargument from personal incredulity.\u201d This is when an author says things like \u201cIt is impossible for me to believe,\u201d or \u201cI cannot even imagine this to be so,\u201d and the like. Again, the author is using the seeming likelihood of a certain outcome as an argument; but unfortunately for us reality doesn't care what we find easy to believe, or what we think likely to happen. So because the arguments employed were not based on either philosophical principles or empirical data, I was often left cold. In fact, I was frequently reminded of a criticism Bertrand Russell made of St. Thomas Aquinas. Russell did not consider Aquinas to be a great philosopher because Aquinas began with his conclusions, which he got from Aristotle and the Bible, instead of following his logic wherever it led. Similarly, the authors of these papers started with their conclusion\u2014that we should ratify the Constitution\u2014and then grasped for arguments, like a lawyer defending his client. Of course, that\u2019s the nature of propaganda; but it isn\u2019t very intellectually stimulating.Aside from the writing and the rhetoric, a third barrier to a pleasant reading experience for me was simply the subject-matter. Many of these essays get into the nitty-gritty of the proposed administration. It often felt as if I were reading a proposal to reorganize a department at work rather than a book of political philosophy. I\u2019m sure if I wasn\u2019t such a troglodyte I would have gotten more out of these managerial niceties; but as I am still thoroughly lodged under a rock, I frequently found it impossible to focus. My eyes would get blurry; my brain would turn off; and I would read several pages on autopilot before realizing that I wasn\u2019t absorbing a thing.Alright, so I\u2019ve discussed all the negatives. But despite all I\u2019ve said, I still think this book is well worth reading. Madison\u2019s essays, in particular, were for me the real highlight, even though they only comprised about a third of this book. Compared with Hamilton, Madison is much more of a theorist. His famous Federalist No. 10 is as deep as anything in Montesquieu, Marx, Machiavelli, or any other political philosopher whose name starts with an M. What\u2019s more, he struck me as more widely learned, often making reference to ancient history as illustrations. And to be fair, the indefatigable Hamilton, though often tiresome, is not without his moments of greatness. He at least possesses the merit of being diligent and thorough.Yet the real treat, I\u2019d argue, is not reading the articles themselves, but reading the Constitution afterwards. By the time you get to the very end of The Federalist Papers, and turn to that slim founding document in the very back, you will have spent a dozen or more hours interpreting, defending, and exploring these 10 humble pages, tucked away like an appendix. Every sentence in the Constitution has been explained, clarified, and justified with excruciating care. And as a result, it was as if I was reading it for the first time\u2014which is worth some literary boredom and headache, if you ask me.\n", u'\n           \n           First, I\'m going to begin with a bitch. THIS "BOOK" WAS NOT WRITTEN BY ALEXANDER HAMILTON. IT IS NOT A BOOK. IT IS A COMPILATION OF SEVERAL ESSAYS WRITTEN UNDER THE PSEUDONYM "PUBLIUS" AND THE AUTHOR(S) WERE ANONYMOUS FOR A LONG TIME.The true authorship of these was only known several years after the fact. And took several decades after the authors had been determined to finalize exactly who wrote what.Furthermore, virtually ever copy includes at least a copy of the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, and (if you\'re very lucky) The Articles of confederation.None of the US foundational documents were conceivably written by Alexander Hamilton. However, he did write the vast majority of the Federalist Papers.There are hundreds of printings of this work. The copy I read well over 200 times (well, the first 30 of the federalists or so, anyway) was a deep red mass market paperback. I can\'t remember the publisher. There was a publisher that made all its mass market "classic" paperbacks in deep red for awhile. It had the lovely disintegrating acidic paper, and the binding was just starting to fall apart as I slugged the bottle of champagne and vowed to not read the work again until I was 30.Anyway, this is an incredible book if you\'re willing to read it well. That means at least one week for one paper. I\'m not kidding. It benefits very much from close reading.All the hype is true, but reading it poorly makes it sound like pithy bullshit. Follow the terminology in the paper, and put together the relationships between all terms. Anyway, read it.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'16007959', u'\xc1llam\xe9letrajzok', u'222', u'\n6527036\nGy\xf6rgy N\xe9meth\nEditor\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6527036.Gy_rgy_N_meth\n3.73\n11\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'Osiris Kiad\xf3', u'Az \xc1llam\xe9letrajzok c\xedm\u0171 gy\u0171jtem\xe9ny tartalmazza az \xf6sszes fennmaradt forr\xe1st, amely a g\xf6r\xf6g \xe1llamok m\u0171k\xf6d\xe9s\xe9t \xedrja le.

The family thrives in the US in the prosperous 1920\'s, though the school-age David is bullied by anti-Semitic local boys, and he is haunted by whispered secrets of his father\'s past as a militant activist among Jews in the "old country." We follow this family through the Great Depression and into World War II, as its members learn of the Nazis\' cruelty to family and acquaintances they left behind in Europe. It seems like this is primarily the story of the Jewish experience in NYC in the 1920\'s -1940\'s. Then in the final portion of the book, there is a completely new plot twist as the author focuses on David\'s decision to lay aside his orthodox beliefs to pursue secular Biblical criticism, thereby shocking his family and friends at a time when they were still reeling from the reality of the Holocaust.Each of the main characters are completely life-like and compelling. Their story is told from an uncommon perspective, and gives you an empathy and understanding for their conflicts even though their culture is foreign.

David loves the Torah and his Jewish culture. He excels at school but lives in 1930, a time filled with anti-semitism. His father is a leader of the Jewish community who fled with his wife from Poland and pogroms. They bring many people to America through their Jewish community and watch over each other. Their families do not all come and Hitler rises to power. During David's growing years he sees the anguish of his family as they lose everything material first to the stock market crash and then family to Concentration Camps. They rebuild their lives, speaking to the resiliancy of the Jewish people as a whole. I marvel at their history and the dedication required to be a practicing Jew. I learned more about their culture and took many times to pause for reflection at the cruelty of the world we live in but also the beauty that can be enjoyed.

The tone will be practical, not academic. The working assumption is that readers want to know what (and what not) might or should be done, without over emphasis on the why. That said, it is important to review the crucial basic science necessary for effective diagnosis and management, and to provide reminders in the context of the practical chapters.The books will not be heavily referenced, in line with a more practical approach. This allows for smoother reading (and also relieves the burden of comprehensive citing from authors). Key evidence (clinical trials, Cochrane or other meta analyses) should be summarized in 'Evidence at a Glance' boxes and key references such as reviews, major papers can be provided in the 'selected bibliography' at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Practical guidance will be provided through: the use of algorithms and guidelines where they are appropriate'Tips and Tricks' boxes - hints on improving outcomes perhaps via practical technique, patient questioning etc'Caution' warning boxes - hints on avoiding problems, perhaps via contraindications'Science Revisited' - quick reminder of the basic science principles necessary for understanding", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'29428391', u'A Textbook on HIV Infection and AIDS in Adolescents', u' ', u'\n14543318\nM.

One Human Minute is apparently a Guinness Book of World Records  that is completely mundane, yet also amped up on steroids. Imagine a book that is full of tables upon tables and graphs and charts about everything that happens on earth per minute. How many babies are born, how many people get struck by lightning, how many people are tortured by electricity, how many orgasms are achieved per minute...Definitely a philosophical piece, but seemed to be musing about the depravity of the human race. I'm not sure if I missed the point.The Upside-Down Revolution: The evolution of military and warfare...written under the premise that the author has a history book from the future and publishes it in the present as science fiction. I lost interest partway through this one.The World as Cataclysm: I have a fascination with astrophysics. I am fully aware that the bulk of it goes over my head and I have near zero retention, but that doesn't stop me from reading/watching anything on the subject that is remotely geared towards the layman. Simply Fascinating. This piece goes into the probabilities of extraterrestrial life.

They are assisted in their investigation by Fat Ollie Weeks of the 83rd Precinct and, as always, this is something of a mixed blessing.Meanwhile, Eileen Burke of the Rape Squad is undercover, attempting to catch a particularly sadistic rapist who continues to attack the same few women over and over again. Burke is acting as a stand-in for one of the victims, hoping that she will be able to decoy the rapist into attacking her and that this will give her the opportunity to arrest him.As always, the story is well-written; the police procedures are interesting and the by-play among the detectives is entertaining. But there's a certain creepiness factor involved with both storylines that kept me from enjoying the book as much as I otherwise would have. I'm not normally overly sensitive to this sort of thing, but in this case McBain is so good at creating truly repulsive situations that I found myself wanting to cover my eyes at some points. Thus three stars for me rather than four.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Two parallel investigations of very unpleasant crimes - murder with the victims left hanging, and multiple rapes. Carella, Hawes, Kling and fat Ollie all involved tracking the perpetrators, with Eileen Burke, now Kling's girlfriend as a rape decoy again. Quite a shocking book in many ways.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Two good plots again, with some good natured ribbing of Meyer Meyer, who sports a wig in this novel. A rapist is repeatedly attacking the same women, bringing Kling's new girlfriend to act as a lure. However, another female cop figures out the motive and then finds the criminal with terrific detective work. Meanwhile, young female track stars are being hung from lampposts, and Fat Ollie Weeks beings his bigotry down to the 87th to help solve the case.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I like the writer's style, I like the characters except for the ones I'm not supposed to like. McBain can write really unpleasant characters when he decides to.I listened to the abridged version - two cassette tapes - and the story was probably abridged TOO much. At the halfway point I was tempted to abandon the book because I wasn't really all that interested in either of the cases. I'm glad I stuck with it, the endings were worth it.That's another thing - since McBain is a new-to-me author, I have not yet gotten the rhythm of his writing. I keep expecting the two cases to merge or overlap and they don't. Not a bad thing, just different for me.I will continue to read this author.\n         ", u'\n           \n           McBain does it again, his ability to submerge the reader into the psyche of the "squad room", from the perspective of multiple squad members; each with their own thoughts, theories and nuances about the cases...which incidentally involve a sadistic serial rapist AND a lunatic who has decided to hang women from lampposts. I often think McBain has changed the focus of the mystery genre...from who-done-it , to who-solved-it. As his cast of police characters each scramble through the unending reports, interviews, surveillance and searches to get to collar up on the perp they are chasing. Flawlessly developed with just the right crescendo of suspense and side bar relief...this one is McBain at his very best.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'14876089', u'Women of the Bible Access', u' ', u'\n5158478\nAnonymous\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous\n4.15\n1078039\n56497\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'24556297', u'ILCS Chapter 625 2013: Vehicles', u' ', u'\n5171804\nLawBox LLC\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5171804.LawBox_LLC\n3.60\n5\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'19774973', u'Teaching Shakespeare: Passing It On', u' ', u'\n4347399\nG.B.

But what is the American Dream, exactly, and how has it changed over the course of America\'s history? This is the question that Bob Skandalaris and Amber Clark explore in their latest book, The Evolution of the American Dream. From the dream of land and a new start in the colonial era, to the dream of political and religious freedom during the Revolutionary War, to the dream of living a life of self-reliance on the frontier or amassing a vast fortune as a captain of industry in the nineteenth century, the American Dream has constantly evolved. By the early twentieth century, it was living the good life; then during the Great Depression it took a sharp swing toward security and ensuring the comforts of a middle-class lifestyle rather than chasing a better one. As prosperity returned after World War II, the dream morphed into a house in the suburbs and a college education for one\'s children, and then into a vision of a Great Society where government could cure all social ills and ensure constant upward mobility. That version of the American Dream, however, cannot last. In an era of global capitalism, the American Dream has now become the Chinese Dream, the Indian Dream, and the World Dream. People across the globe are not only taking "our" jobs, but also appropriating the dream itself-and the question is, what will that do to the American Dream for Americans? Will it force us to reinvent and redefine the dream once more, as we have done so often in the past? Or will the American Dream disappear from our shores entirely? Is the there still an authentic, achievable version of the American Dream today?', u'43', u'4.33', u'3', [], [u"\n           \n           This was a pretty amazing book. I really enjoyed learning the history of how the American Dream came to mean what it does today.This is really a great book, and made me think quite a bit about what I want from the government versus what I want to be able to accomplish as an American.Finally --- and this is probably the best compliment I can say about the author --- this is a book that can have quite a large political bent to it; but throughout the whole book, it was not apparent whether he was a liberal or conservative, or other. This made it more enjoyable since it wasn't skewed towards a single audience.Overall, a GREAT book!!!

Tasked with overseeing Alex and her young ward during their visit to the ranch, Buck finds himself falling for both the woman and the little girl.

When Buck and his friends Carson and Ross left the Marines each was suffering from lung disease from the war and a need to give back after surviving the war when so many hadn't. They began a Dude Ranch which also invites the families of the fallen for a special vacation. This month's visitors are assigned to Buck for their week. Buck is enchanted by seven year old Jenny and completely smitten by her oh-so-young grandmother. But Alex is already committed to a man back home and Buck won't go after another man's girl. He can't help but dream a little of a future with both of them.I loved Buck. He noticed Alex even before he knew who they were, and once he did he was thrilled to be able to spend time with them. Thanks to having nieces and nephews he was already good with kids, but Jenny was something special. He had a hard time believing that Alex was Jenny's grandmother with as young as she looked. That didn't really matter to him but finding out she was committed to another man caused him to step back. A long time ago his girlfriend left him for another man - his own brother. Since that time he hadn't had a real relationship with another woman, only light ones. I loved seeing Buck with the kids and how good he was with them. In spite of his health issues he was pretty spontaneous and fun loving. He was also calm in a crisis which helped when Jenny got hurt. Buck has a hard time thinking he's good enough for Alex when he thinks of what she is used to in her current life. When Buck was given a second chance with Alex he had to decide if he was willing to risk his heart. Alex was pretty terrific. She had had a baby at seventeen but managed to get her education and make a good life her her and her daughter. When her daughter also started young, Alex became a very young grandmother. She was Jenny's only family now, since her daughter had died and her son-in-law had been killed in Afghanistan. She was engaged to a very nice man who was older than she was, and with whom she'd been friends with for a long time. Jenny wasn't adjusting well to the engagement and when the invitation to the ranch came Alex thought it would be a great distraction. She was immediately impressed with Buck's rapport with Jenny and how he was able to calm her through the storm. She was amazed by how quickly Jenny became attached to Buck. She also found herself noticing Buck in a way she hadn't noticed a man in many years, but tried to ignore it because of their age difference. She was later surprised to find that it was only five years. I loved the way that she so quickly came to like the area and how it began to change her. Buck had told her that the Tetons had a way of changing a person's perspective and she found that to be true. I loved the way that she and Jenny came back to the ranch and how she and Buck had a chance to talk some. I loved the way she went to support him with his family and how they finally got everything straight between them. I loved the epilogue and can't wait for the next book.I loved the two kids, Jenny and Johnny. I thought both were portrayed pretty accurately for their ages. I loved Jenny's immediate connection with Buck and what a difference it seemed to make in his life. It really showed, too, what a terrific father he'd make.The only problem I had with the book was with Harlequin's continuing inability to accept that the word Marine is ALWAYS capitalized. Every time I saw marine or ex-marine, it pulled me out of the story. \n         ", u'\n4.5 StarsIn Home to Wyoming by Rebecca Winters, Buck Summerhayes wants to put the past behind him, especially everything that happened in Afghanistan during the war but he cannot go back to the family construction business, so he goes into a partnership with two of his friends Carson and Ross from the military hospital to open a dude ranch in Teton Valley, and honor a fallen soldier by inviting his widow and children to stay for a weeklong stay with all expenses paid.This is the second family to be invited to the ranch and it\u2019s Buck\u2019s turn to take care of them. But Buck is stuck in the airport waiting to fly back from a brief visit to his family. As he is waiting he admires the sexy woman with her sleeping daughter sitting next to him. Too bad that his cough starts acting up and wakes up the little girl. To his chagrin the mother asks the little girl to go to the restroom before their flight is called, and he believes that it\u2019s only to get away from him.

This is what education activist and writer Pamela Lewis has set upon to do in her compelling book, Teaching While Black: A New Voice on Race and Education in New York City. As the title suggests, embracing blackness in the classroom can be threatening to many and thus challenging to carry out in the present school system. <br />Unapologetic and gritty, Teaching While Black offers an insightful, honest portrayal of Lewis's turbulent eleven-year relationship within the New York City public school system and her fight to survive in a profession that has undervalued her worth and her understanding of how children of color learn best. Tracing her educational journey with its roots in the North Bronx, Lewis paints a vivid, intimate picture of her battle to be heard in a system struggling to unlock the minds of the children it serves, while stifling the voices of teachers of color who hold the key. The reader gains full access to a perspective that has been virtually ignored since the No Child Left Behind Act, through which questions surrounding increased resignation rates by teachers of color and failing test scores can be answered. <br />Teaching While Black is both a deeply personal narrative of a black woman's real-life experiences and a clarion call for culturally responsive teaching. Lewis fearlessly addresses the reality of toxic school culture head-on and gives readers an inside look at the inert bureaucracy, heavy-handed administrators, and ineffective approach to pedagogy that prevent inner-city kids from learning. At the heart of Lewis's moving narrative is her passion. Each chapter delves deeper into the author's conscious uncoupling from the current trends in public education that diminish proven remedies for academic underachievement, as observed from her own experiences as a teacher of students of color. <br />Teaching While Black summons everyone to re-examine what good teaching looks like. Through a powerful vision, together with practical ideas and strategies for teachers navigating very difficult waters, Lewis delivers hope for the future of teaching and learning in inner-city schools.", u'7', u'5.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'19076193', u'Walking the Sleep', u' ', u'\n7461479\nMark McGhee\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7461479.Mark_McGhee\n5.00\n1\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'10', u'5.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'17191608', u'Storia dei Longobardi', u'211', u'\n1892997\nPaul the Deacon\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1892997.Paul_the_Deacon\n3.77\n65\n7\n', u'1994', u'11', u'', u'Mondadori', u'Scritta verso la fine dell\'VIII secolo, unica nel suo tempo per la completezza, la salda linearit\xe0 dell\'impostazione e il fascino narrativo, la <i>Storia dei Longobardi</i> di Paolo Diacono costituisce una delle fonti principali per la conoscenza del popolo di origine nordica che tra il VI e l\'VIII secolo "unific\xf2" l\'Italia fondandovi un regno barbarico i cui confini andavano dalle Alpi fino all\'estremo meridione della penisola.

Those of you like me who love Germanic mythology probably know about the Eddas and sagas of Iceland. Then there is Snorri Sturluson's History of the Kings of Norway. Although called a history, there is much legendary material here. If that does not satisfy you, then there is Saxo's History of the Danes books 1-9. This is another book filled with wonderful stories, some that even parallel the ones found in the Eddas. If you still crave more, then you may now turn to this little book on the Langobards. They are also called the Lombards, and they invaded Italy in the 6th century. We remember them today in the name of the province of Italy called Lombardy. Here you will learn about their fortunes and failures, and their interactions with all of the other peoples of the time: Franks, Avars, Byzantines and others. There are some notable myths here such as how Odin gave the Langobards their name and how Alboin got his sword. Probably the most popular story is how Alboin made a cup out of the skull of his enemy! For those Norse/Germanic enthusiasts out there: where else do you see this story?Sure, there is some dullness to this tome: Paul's book sometimes feels like a series of facts without feeling like an engaging and unified story of these people. And there is a lot here that would interest the academic rather than the general reader, who would most likely want to read a more up to date history. But the book really shines once Paul starts reciting a juicy tale rather than just another fact about which king succeeded whom.\n         ", u"\n           \n           De geschiedenis van de Germaanse stam der Langobarden, vanaf hun mythische begin in Zweden, via hun trek naar het zuiden, hun tijdelijke vestiging in Pannoni\xeb (Hongarije), hun inval in Itali\xeb en hun verovering van een groot deel ervan.Paulus' verhaal wordt gelardeerd met mooie verhalen, legenden, daden van heiligen, wonderen, religieuze twisten, natuurrampen, epidemie\xebn en berichten van wat er ondertussen gaande was in Frankenland en in het Oost-Romeinse rijk. Een groot deel speelt zich af op de grens van de oudheid en de middeleeuwen, toen Frankrijk nog Galli\xeb heette, de oorspronkelijke inwoners van Itali\xeb nog Romeinen en Europa bevolkt werd door stammen als de Franken, de Beieren, de Avaren en later ook de Bulgaren, de Slaven en nog later de Saracenen, die Sicili\xeb, heel Spanje en zelfs een flink stuk van Zuid-Frankrijk bezetten. Deze berichten plaatsen de geschiedenis van de Langobarden, dat vol staat van intriges, opstanden, burgeroorlogjes, koningsmoorden, verraad en conflicten met buurstammen in een grotere contekst.Paulus Diaconus (zelf Langobard) vertelt levendig en weet deze verloren wereld goed op te roepen en tegelijk ongewild goed duidelijk te maken dat het geen feest was om in deze tijd te leven, want als gewone man kon je gemakkelijk sterven omdat je hertog in opstand kwam en gestraft werd, omdat je stad veroverd werd door woeste naburige stammen, omdat de pest heerstte, of droogte, of ernstige overstromingen.

I'm in love with love! Jay McLean navigates readers on an emotional journey. Full with plenty of ups, downs and shake ups that move you, whether it\u2019s to amuse you, bemuse you or just shatter you in to pieces. More Than Forever hits you at all angles: death, life, love, hate, rejection, acceptance and change to name a few.Unlike the previous books in this series More Than Forever takes you back in time. It starts with a young Lucy, only 15, a girl carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. A world that is about to be forever changed\u2026Cameron has been assisting with little league, when practice ends he spots her in the stands, sitting on a bench reading with her kindle in one hand as her foot gently rocks a stroller to soothe baby Lachlan. That\u2019s when it happens, thunder bolt, cupid\u2019s arrow, love at first sight, whatever it is you would like to call it. He falls and he falls hard.Cam quickly realizes that not everything is how it seems. He comes to understand that Lucy is going through her daily routine which pretty much has her caring for her younger brothers because her mother is ill and no longer able to do so. She is literally living on auto pilot. When tragedy strikes he is the only one who sees the real Lucy and it is then that he learns her dark secret. Cam takes it upon himself to help out with the boys. Without so much as a second glance Luce continues to do her part and care for her siblings only now she has help; whether she wants it or not.With a big heart and a calming presence Cam manages to become a big part of Lucy\u2019s life. Before she even realizes it he soon holds a place in her heart. A permanent place. A forever place.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fierce.\u201d His brows rise. \u201cFierce?\u201d\u201cYeah. The way he protects me. It\u2019s fierce. He\u2019s fierce.\u201d\n -Lucy talking to her dad about CamWhen I entered Lucy and Cam\u2019s 'More' world I had no idea what to expect, we\u2019ve only had small glimpses of Cam and hilarious doses of a drunk Lucy in prior books. MTF has you at the forefront of their lives. What I found so beautiful about this story is its two main characters and the ease at which they connected at such a young age. \n\u201cYou make me want to try.\u201d He whispers in my ear.\n -Cam It was said that Cam has a heart the size of the ocean and I must say I totally agree. He was able to take Lucy\u2019s crumbling world and rebuild it minus any judgment. Because seeing Lucy at her lowest point made him run towards her NOT away.I really really enjoyed the way their relationship blossomed from their teens and carried in to adulthood. It was wonderfully and flawlessly executed. You get the innocence of first love, the tenderness of a first kiss, the loss of virginity, the transition to college, new responsibilities of juggling school, work and a relationship. All of these pivotal life changes occur. Each has an impact on their relationship, some good, some not so good.\n \u2018As much as it hurts to admit, things have changed. I don\u2019t know if its me, or him, or both of us.\u2019\n -Lucy After 5 years of being together Lucy and Cam experience some horrible growing pains. I felt so bad for them. But I also felt that it was captured honestly. What I thought was important during this time is how never..not for one second did I doubt their love for one another. Still, like every other couple they experience challenges. Nothing in life is perfect, right. After all its how we overcome and learn from those challenges in life that truly matter.Take the journey! Come live, learn and love with Cam and Lucy in More Than Forever!\n\u2018Sometimes we talk. Most of the time it\u2019s just me talking, trying to make her laugh. Trying to gift my ears with the sound that makes my world stop.\u2019 \n \u2013Cam\nMy Sweet and Sour\nMy Sweet- My Forever, by Cameron Loves You More Annnnd Lucas!! Jay, give us MORE Lucas!!!My Sour- Wellll, it begins with an R ends with a Y. WAIT! To those who read the book already\u2026Did anyone peep this\u2026how it was said that Tom made the counter higher in the kitchen on purpose\u2026because he was described as tall but that\u2019s not why it was so he could sex up his wife. *wiggles eyebrows* GREAT inside joke he shared with his wife. Too cute!My ThoughtsI LOVED IT! If I had to describe the writing I would say it's beautifully written, fantastically witty and totally raw. Although Lucy suffered a big loss in More Than Forever it did not over shadow the story. Jay McLean manages to find a balance also nothing drags along. Just when I thought the book was about to slip in to a predictable story line McLean hit the brakes and surprised me. That scene when Cam finally puts two and two together....One thing about McLean\u2019s style is that she likes to show case relationships. Not too many authors have the ability to write in the parents the way McLean does. She makes you wish your parents were that cool. And if your parents are already that cool, well, you\u2019re just that damn lucky.Smart mouth Lucy? I felt like she was in and out. Sometimes I\u2019d expect something crazy to fly out her mouth and then I\u2019d remember most times she was drunk when that happened in previous books. In MTF we get to know the many sides of Lucy.

To say that I was scared to read their story is a gross understatement. In my eyes they were perfect. \n\n"You\'re my art, Luce. My heart."\n\nThe first half of the book...watching Cam and Lucy fall in love....there are no words. Cam came in to Lucy\'s life when she needed somone the most. When she was at her lowest. He gave her strength when she had none. He gave her \nhope\n!Cam was Lucy\'s rock. He was a hero to Lucy\'s brother\'s. He was light in Lucy\'s dark. They fell in love at just fifteen years old. A forever love. Their forever. \n\n"...he made my impossible, possible. And he had absolutely no idea he was doing it."\n\nThe second half of the book....watching Cam and Lucy fight for that love.....it hurt. It made me cry. My heart broke for them. There was pain. There was loss. There was heart-ache. But their love for each other was so strong. Not once did I ever question that love. Despite what Cam and Lucy went through, I never once doubted their devotion to each other. I was never once uncertain about how they felt about each other. \n\n"I love you, Lucy. I\'ll always love you, even if you don\'t know it. So...even if forever is eternal, I promise to love you for our forever."\n\nTheir love story wasn\'t perfect, but it was theirs.

Just Wow! Lucy and Cameron\u2019s story was wonderful in every way possible. Jay McLean finally shared with fans of this series the complete story of Lucy and Cameron. They have been in each book of this series and always inspired the struggling couple that love conquers all. Jay McLean took Lucy our quirky funny character and didn\u2019t overdo her (which I was worried about) and added Cameron who was just completely swoonworthy and most definitely fierce. She told their story one of sadness and hope did it with humor, steam and heart.This story is an experience, one of a first love that never diminished through the years. It will have you laughing and crying while you accompany them experiencing all their firsts together. Overall, this story is must read for fans of the series, and for those who dream of a love like theirs.\n\u201dYou can keep your two wishes, I\u2019ll just take the one. I want my girl, Lucy. My forever. And not just for our forever, but for eternity, and for always.\u201d\n\n', u'\n5 Eternal Stars. Cameron and Lucy fell in love when they were 15 years old and Lucy\u2019s life was in a bad place. They never stopped falling in love and when they go to college they still are much in love as the first day. They shared everything: smiles, tears, laughter, the first experiences and their lives. However their story isn\u2019t perfect. It install always unicorn-shaped rainbows and cupcakes. Their story had up\u2019s and downs. Happy and sad tears. Bad moments and amazing ones. So jump on this and read their journey. It surely is an amazing one. \xb4I fell in love with Cameron and Lucy in the first book and their story didn\u2019t disappointed. Not only this is probably my new favorite NA book, but it has to be one of the bests ever written. Yes, it had some angst, but we\u2019re dealing with teenagers turning into adults: it was prone to have. For every angsty moment we had an amazing one so it was all good. And the Aladdin stuff was seriously awesome! This was a beautiful story and I loved how it begin when they were 15 and went on the rest of their lives. If you\u2019re looking for an amazing romance book, please, try this one. Rating:  5 Stars. Characters Development:  These two broke my heart and sew it back together again in just a few chapters. They\u2019re one of my favorite couples ever written. I loved Lucy since the first book (probably because she\u2019s a Bookaholic and we can totally relate to that :P) and I loved her even more in this book. And Cam? Cameron is the most considerate, sweet and amazing guy. I loved how he always was there for Lucy and even when he was too stupid for his own good (oh well, guys\u2026) he was always too swoony and honest and impossible not to love him. I loved Lucy\u2019s brothers and how the rest of the gang was always there for them. Best group of friends, ever! Steam:  Nice hot moments.

It\'s lyrical. It picks you up and carries you along. You are swept through streams of consciousness, and through herbal medicinal books, and then through third person narrative. You switch from one to the other seamlessly. It\'s a masterpiece in that regard.But I am left with one overwhelming question.What the fuck was that all about?I mean I get it. It\'s the story of Jon\xe1s the Learned and his exile. It\'s about the amazing things he does or witnesses before he is accused of sorcery. It is about his weird magic realism visions. It\'s about his wonderfully patient wife. It\'s about him going to Denmark. But... what\'s the point?I dislike getting to the end of the book and being thoroughly confused. It\'s the awkward break up conversation. "It\'s not you, it\'s me. I just don\'t think I can see this going any where." The book is as silent as my exes on the receiving end of the speech. Which could be a credit to my exes. But you just burble to fill in the space. In the end you just convince the other person they are better off without you or your understanding, because you have just revealed yourself as being slightly insane and they feel like they have dodged a bullet. "Why doesn\'t this girl just shut up?!?"But I don\'t like that it my reading. The book that is cute and charming enough to get you to snog it while you\'re a little bit drunk, and then wake up thinking "What the hell did I just do? Please tell me it\'s not lying next to me." The book that tells you these epic sagas and then gets to the punchline and tells you "Oh I would tell you the point but it\'s too existential for you." (which is an "excuse" I was given by a staff member turning up 5 hours late for a shift (shifts were 4 hours long)).See. This makes me grumpy. It conjures up images of break ups, drunken snogs with pretty, vapid boys and horrible prats who think they are all higher plane but are just fuckwits. It takes you on a pretty journey and I don\'t get the conclusion. If there is one. And I just don\'t know why I was taken on the journey.I really do wonder if it is a cultural thing. Do I not get it coz I\'m not Icelandic or even Scandinavian? I\'d hope not but I may be right. I will read another of his books. I hope it is just this book, and it is the longest of them all. But I am prepared to be completely confused again. I\'m not saying don\'t read it, just in case it is really me.For more reviews, visit: http://rusalkii.blogspot.com.au/\n', u'\n           \n           Translated from the Icelandic by Victoria CribbWithdrawn from Tower Hamlets LibrariesDescription: The year is 1635. Iceland is a world darkened by superstition, poverty, and cruelty.Men of science marvel over a unicorn\'s horn, poor folk worship the Virgin in secret, and both books and men are burnt.Jonas Palmason, a poet and self-taught healer, has been condemned to exile for heretical conduct, having fallen foul of the local magistrate. Banished to a barren island, Jonas recalls his gift for curing "female maladies," his exorcism of a walking corpse on the remote Snjafjoll coast, the frenzied massacre of innocent Basque whalers at the hands of local villagers, and the deaths of three of his children.Opening: A medium-sized fellow... beady brown eyes set close to his beak within pale surrounds... the beak itself quite long, thick and powerful, with a slight downward curve at the end, dark in colour but lighter at the top... no neck to speak of; a spry, stocky figure with short, tapering legs, a barrel chest and a big belly... head a dark grizzled brown, with a ruff extending from nape to mid-crown...\n', u"\n           \n           From the raw, volcanic landscape of early seventeenth century Iceland, with ancient myths of mermen and unicorns tumbling from its fissures; a land of endless nights, burning snow and whales the size of mountains; Sjon has crafted an extraordinary novel, which has been deservedly longlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize.'From The Mouth Of The Whale' conjures a precipitous landscape upon which early Lutheranism has taken a violent hold, making the population paranoid of old pagan rituals such as those supposedly employed by Jonas Palmason the Learned, an insatiable scholar who combines medicinal practices with his vast knowledge of the properties of his nation's plants and animals: coral, for example, of which it has been proved that 'if [it] is heated until it glows, then quenched in warm milk, and afterwards drunk by the man who has no appetite or a gripe in the guts, he will be cured. Some claim that coral must be what the ancients referred to as the work of mermen or dwarfs.'Convicted of heresy, Jonas is banished to spend the rest of his life in exile on a rocky islet, from where he reveals his shocking, yet curiously life-affirming story.Jonas recalls his famous exorcism of a walking corpse at Snjafjoll, the deaths of his children and, in the book's most disturbing and unforgettable passage, the massacre of a band of Basque whalers. In doing so he poses crucial contemporary questions about the corrupting power of religion, and the inherent fraility of humanity.In another memorable scene, Jonas is shipped to Denmark in order to plead for his freedom: there, he meets the doctor and natural philosopher Ole Worm, with whom he takes great delight in exposing some of the very myths which he has been punished for allegedly perpetrating.Upon being presented with a specimen believed by great-and-good Danes to be a unicorn's horn, Jonas 'began to laugh and could not stop. His short legs buckled under his quaking body and he dropped to the floor, where he lay hooting as if he were in tears.' The specimen is, in fact, nothing more than a narwhal tusk.'The Icelanders had first encountered these horrid beasts when they founded a colony on Greenland around the year 1000 Anno Domini and soon began to export the tusks, labelling them as 'unicorn horns' according to the latest fashion. The Greenlanders and their middlemen in west Iceland grew fat on the profits of this secret commerce, which ensured the Greenlandic colony an advantageous balance of trade with foreign lands as well as laying the foundation for the wealth of the most powerful families in Iceland.'Jonas soon finds himself billeted back on his islet: his wife now dead, he is condemned to see out the rest of his days alone. It is no surprise to find him cynical about human nature - 'the dead generally possess more fortitude than the living, as is clear by the way they lie still in their graves'.The beauty of this book lies in the author's splendid excavation of Icelandic history and legend; in his evocation of his nation's untamed natural wonders; in his damning indictment of religious doctrine; in his heady blend of hallucination and tumultuous picaresque. It is a book of stunning originality and profound oddity, such that its flawless translation from its original Icelandic is no mean feat: for that achievement, Victoria Cribb deserves special mention and enormous praise.This is a book worthy of winning any prize. Its judges can rest assured that they would never pick another winner quite like it. \n         ", u"\n           \n           A pretty solid novel which - after not being particularly impressed by The Blue Fox and The Whispering Muse - gave me some understanding of all the fuss about Sj\xf3n.It's also a satisfying read for the early modern European history buff, given that in English we don't hear much about seventeenth-century Iceland and Denmark without looking for it. From the Mouth of the Whale is based on the life-story of Icelandic autodidact J\xf3n the Learned, here renamed J\xf3nas, who, like many famous thinkers of his era, dabbled in a mixture of what we'd now call science and magic, and provoked the wrath of the church. (There are a few metafictional hints that Sj\xf3n feels J\xf3n(as) and his wife to have been his intellectual ancestors.) During the course of his adventures J\xf3nas travels to Copenhagen and works with the somewhat better-known polymath Ole Worm. Lest this sound like a book about men in doublets sitting around talking, there's more adventure than you find in the average litfic novel, intellectual pranks involving narwhal horns, and a moving account of life in a harsh landscape both physical and ideological. It was disappointing not to hear more about J\xf3nas's wife Sigga, an equally interesting character who began as a farmer's daughter with a natural genius for maths and astronomy, mostly self-taught following a few basic lessons from a local vicar. Decades later, after the deaths of several of their children, little or no opportunity to develop her own gifts, and following her husband around on various household moves prompted by rumours and persecution, she is a depressed, angry woman who says little more than \u201cThat's the sort of nonsense that got us here in the first place\u201d. Given the choice to use narrative shifts between first and third person, and switches from stream-of-consciousness to standard storytelling, it's a shame Sj\xf3n didn't also include a section narrated by Sigga. As it stood, with the narrative always concentrating on J\xf3nas, these shifts were the book's greatest weakness - most were pointless and detracted from the flow of an otherwise interesting story.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'36651756', u'En G\xfczel Piyano Sonatinleri', u'144', u'\n17360927\nBelir Tecimer\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17360927.Belir_Tecimer\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2017', u'11', u'', u'Arkada\u015f Yay\u0131nc\u0131l\u0131k', u'Prof. Dr. Belir TEC\u0130MER \u0130zmir\u2019de do\u011fdu.

'The Poor in Liberation Theology' questions whether the effect of liberation theology is to provide a pathway to God or really to construct idols out of the poor. Combining the conceptual language of the philosophers Jean-Luc Marion and Emmanuel Levinas with the methodology of the liberation theologian Clodovis Boff, the volume outlines how liberation theology can work to ensure the poor do not become an ideological construct but remain icons of God.

The story is a journey about a girl who has lost hope and a boy living his dreams. \nSummer is a girl facing difficulties to accept her parents\' situation and that breaking her down! Without realising has been keeping herself away. And then, she decides to go back to her farm and help her dad. Enters Ford, the new intern. \nThey resist each other but one day, everything seems about taking a risk!\nHow will these two get along?if you are for a simple country style read,pick this one up! "Summer Stafford, you could never be meaningless" Happy reading D xo **ARC provided for review**\n         ', u'\n           \n           I decided not to read any reviews and went straight into reading this with no expectations at all. I was shallow that the reason I only went for this was the cover with a bit of interest in the storyline. So, diving in, I never would\'ve thought that this would take me into such a wonderful ride. Maybe, it\u2019s just me. Maybe, it fell on my lap at the right place and at the right time. But I loved every single page of this book. There were just a perfect balance of everything and as I\'m writing this, I realized that I couldn\'t rightfully express how I feel. Obviously, I\'m not a good reviewer here. Lol! And yeah, as much as possible I don\'t like to give too much. Still, I\'d like to say at least some emotions I\'ve felt. The first half of the book, I am definitely loving it, after that, it picked up and went amazing to me. Even though the storyline was totally different to a book that I would like to compare it to, the emotions it brought out on me reminded me so much of "The Edge of Never" and I have never compared any book to my all time fave. So, this means a lot to me. The hero, Ford O\u2019Neal, reminded me of Andrew Parrish as well... with the way he thinks and perceives some things. It didn\'t involve two people travelling across the country but it still dealt with going through a journey, the need for a departure, having realizations and experiencing love. I have to commend the author with how well written this is. She\'d made it so genuine that I got fully connected with each character. It was incredible how well developed they were. More than halfway through it, I was all tears which to be honest hadn\u2019t happened in quite awhile. The kind of crying I had though was not due to pain or bitterness. It was because of love and longing... the questions of "what if" and "what could have been". However, having said all that, the author still managed to make the whole story light and not angst-ridden. It\u2019s like a romantic movie in which it has this therapeutic and invigorating feel right after you\u2019re done watching it. I hope my comparing it to "The Edge of Never" wouldn\'t be stucked on you though. That book was multi-faceted. This was simpler and like I\'ve said, still a light read. Did it have a happily ever after? Uhmm\u2026 Well, there\'s only one way to find out...\n         ', u'\n\n 4 "follow your dreams" kind of stars \n\n\nSummer moved back to her hometown, to help her father after her parents divorce. Their split broke down her foundations, if the most happy and stable couple she knew, could out of the blue, split like that, how is love real?So she goes away from the path that was aligned for her and goes back to her beginning.Among all the familiar and loving faces she sees Ford, and the attraction is immediate. On both sides.Ford is a happy guy, he always follows his dreams and he is focused to not repeat his father mistake and settle down before he achieves them.He wants to live without regret and "what if\'s".Now both of them, while knowing each other will learn a lot about themselves and how unpredictable life is. And that are risks worth taking to achieve our dreams...\n"No matter what happens after this, you\'ve changed me, Summer. I love you for that and for the fact that not once have you asked for that change. What we have, what we are, is beautiful. Don\'t ruin it by worrying about something that hasn\'t happened yet. This moment right here is ours. Let\'s take our moments."\nCharacters Both MC\'s are extremely likable, down to earth, funny and just sizzling together.At first, I was a bit confused about the "drama" between Summer and her mom, how she took so deeply the divorce. But the thing i loved, was how she went gradually more attuned with her emotions and could get passed them.I loved Ford and his take on life and especially, how much the two of them learned from each other!And the chemistry?\nI approve!hahaBesides the 2 of them, my other favorite character is Casey...he his hilarious and just awesome! Overall I really liked it! It was refreshing and not a drama fest.

Coming of Age Tales  in which the protagonist struggles to come out, often against his unsympathetic surroundings. often tender; occasionally mawkish.2. a category that i like to call Gay World Novels in which, oh, everyone is pretty much gay. fine. dream on, gays, dream on. if you can\'t live it...dream it!to me, the self-relegation of most gay novels between these two categories can be annoying, but i suppose understandable. gays have to come out of the closet and so this intense experience is perfectly paired with the classic coming-of-age tale\'s structure. and gays are also often rejected by straight society, so why not rejoice in the telling of tales that in turn reject that straight world, that rolls its eyes at it, that have narratives that seem to posit that straights are the actual minority? Swimming-Pool falls squarely within that second category.the novel is about a repulsive and useless parasite, a shallow and superficial upper-class twit obsessed solely with sex, entirely without any qualities whatsoever except, i suppose, his aristocratic lineage and his apparently smashing good looks and large endowment. unfortunately, the protagonist somehow thinks that he\'s not a complete waste of space. even more unfortunately, the author seems to think that he\'s not so bad, that his thoughts and interests and obsessions and general behavior are not completely infantile and boring. well, i beg to differ, hollinghurst!this is a book of so many wasted opportunities that it becomes truly disgusting. the writer knows how to write: his style is elegant and subtle and full of long, brave sentences and carefully drawn mysteries and surprisingly ambiguous characterization. and he throws it all away by writing about a world THAT CARES ABOUT NOTHING EXCEPT FOR SEX. give me a fucking break, hollinghurst! is this how you see gay people? do they think of nothing but checking people out, eyeing the package of every single dude that crosses their path, rating each body, ignoring all women, living for moments that are only about the interwining of bodies, the randomly chosen hook-up, the spilling of various fluids? do they not have other thoughts, have they no other interests, no other inner or outer life? do their interior monologues consist of nothing but the drooling study of the beauty of the male form? are they incapable of even the slightest depth? do all gays live to celebrate the flesh, and for nothing else whatsoever? when our narrator greets his long-lost lover by ripping his pants down and burying his face in his ass, is this supposed to be palpably romantic rather than absurd and farcical?the novel wastes a golden opportunity in the story of the elderly and very gay Lord Nantwich, whose diaries the protagonist is working his way through as he considers writing a bio of the lord\'s life. learning about this elderly gent\'s story could have been fascinating - a tale of england\'s colonial past, adventures in africa, a recounting of london during some very interesting times, all seen through the lense of an upper class gay outsider. but \'tis not to be. like the narrator of the present, Lord Nantwich is magically surrounded by gay acquaintances and probably-gay-or-maybe-bisexual african natives. almost every single person that either character meets, past or present, is gay or probably-gay-or-bisexual. and even worse, and much like the narrator of the present, Lord Nantwich is also disinterested in recounting anything whatsoever that isn\'t about getting off and ogling all the gay chaps around him. such a potentially vivid life and all he is primarily interested in is getting some action? both characters are resoundingly pathetic - and yet hollinghurst appears to think there is something brave about Lord Nantwich and something charming about our feckless, pointless narrator. at one point, the protagonist idly thumbs through his best friend\'s diary. naturally, his best friend is also obsessed with sex. i guess that\'s how gays are, right? they simply have no other interests.there was one thing that consistently amused me, in a good way: the effete and fatuous queen of a lead character is also a rough, tough top. i like that! it is always interesting when expectations and stereotypes are subverted. sadly, those instances are the only examples of any kind of subversiveness.a part of the novel that struck me as particularly foul was the sexualization of kids. yes, kids can be sexual, i know this of course. but almost an entire chapter devoted to salivating over a junior boxing championship? a short sequence where the narrator describes a family man lovingly patting his child while also lovingly caressing his own hard-on - described as some kind of deep connection...seriously, hollinghurst? the title is laughable. the narrator\'s constant presence at the local english equivalent of the ymca swimming pool is metaphorically (?) tied to his dreamy past hooking up with guys in the school swimming pool, both of which are thematically (?) linked up with Lord Nantwich\'s rather more hedonistic private pool. that is some serious over-reaching there, hollinghurst.the novel has a deeply creepy obsession with race. specifically, blacks. Lord Nantwich is obsessed by them, both africans and african-american soldiers he meets. this is presented with some slight critical distance, but you know what? "slight critical distance" is not enough when the attitude being presented is so barkingly colonial and condescending that it becomes downright repulsive. our charmless hero also starts out with a black boyfriend and much is made of that character\'s stereotypical, lower-class \'blackness\' and, naturally, his dangerous life in the projects. that\'s how blacks are, right? they are either innocent, wide-eyed africans or sexy, violent thugs. and of course the best friend also has his own love of black men - well, their dicks, that is. reading all about an insufferable, body-worshipping twit of a protagonist and an elderly upper-class jackass who lives to objectify eventually made me want to commit some bodily harm on both of them. when the narrator eventually gets his ass kicked, i couldn\'t help but think well finally he is getting a dose of some sort of reality that has nothing to do with worship of the male body or getting fucked.my gosh, i just hated this novel.a little self-disclosure here. i\'m a bi guy. i was out to a select group in high school. i was out to the world in college. i helped start the second iteration of Act-Up San Diego. when i was younger and better looking, i whored myself out a bit (now there\'s a fun fact). i used to volunteer for gay men dying of hiv. now i work for an agency whose clientele is well over half gay. i\'ve gone to jail protesting for the right of gay marriage and the rights of gay teachers to teach children. i think my queer credibility is pretty much impeccable. and i say all this, not just to provide personal context, but mainly because i do not want this review to give the impression that there is any kind of lurking, bottled-up self-hate or any negative attitude towards gay sexuality involved in my rejection of this appalling novel. although i am not a big part of the gay community, i celebrate it and of course am a proud member. but there is nothing to celebrate about this novel. it was a revolting, depressing, infuriating experience for me. apparently The Swimming-Pool Library is considered to be some kind of modern gay classic. that does a profound disservice to the genuinely complex and challenging works and the truly sensitive and moving narratives that exist in this often wonderful subgenre. \n         ', u"\n           \n           A wonderful romp around London-town, arguably the gayest city in all of Europe! The novel is exquisite, very smartly titled (Swimming-pool implies the superficial aspect of the gay scene, Library implies all that is intelligent and witty: the book is a merger of these both). It's at once overly-sensual & incredibly literary.\u201cThe Line of Beauty\u201d seems to be the culmination of Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s steamy/cranial poetics\u2026 this then is barely but a stepping stone toward that epic saga (the Booker winner was turned into a monolithic miniseries by the BBC!). This is a novel of paramount importance: it is a historical document which embodies the livid spirit of the gay scene back in the 1980's, before AIDS, before pretty much stuff like this gave homosexuals a bad rap. It is one-of-a-kind, written eloquently, written with a focus on the elusive antihero: the gay leading man.\n         ", u'\n           \n           This book is tricksily misleading on a number of fronts. It has been described as deeply thrilling and darkly erotic. I think I might have missed something then.... at first appearance it\'s a breezy but self obsessed commentary by flirtatious man about town, William Beckwith; young, moneyed, unscrupulous, charming and gay. The narrative is archly upper class with frequent references to private mens clubs such as the Corinthian and the Athenaeum. The characters are foppish and callow, self serving and frivolous. This is the sort of thing you can get away with when you\'re hideously moneyed apparently. The prose is written in such a way that it took me about 50 pages (until the mention of Bucks Fizz - the pop group not the drink), to work out that this book is set in the 1980\'s. The plumy language and "old school tie" networking really leads you to believe that the setting is the 1920\'s or 30\'s and the lives, loves and language would not be out of place in an Evelyn Waugh novel. Or maybe that was just me and I have read too much Waugh and Wilde of late. The principle character is presented as a watered down version of Boy Mulcaster and Anthony Blanche after they\'ve been through a blender together. However this book has a moral agenda - sort of, a history lesson and hidden depths. William is approached by Lord Nantwich, a man whose life he had previously saved while loitering in a public lavatory, to write his biography and through the research and reading Nantwich\'s diaries he uncovers elements of a sad and unpleasant past, previously hidden to him.I\'ve given this book to two gay friends to read. They both hated it but were not able to explain why and while I continued to turn the pages until the very end, it did not have a profound enough effect to make me read any of more of Hollinghurst\'s work.\n         ', u"\n           \n           The plot was only intermittently absorbing, but the narrator's tones are utterly addictive. I can't get enough of Hollingburst's style. It can delicately register so many things--shades of emotion, nuances of intellection, as well as symphonies of physical movement, as in the suburban boxing tournament--but never sounds fussy or over-elaborate; very solid and quick, a model for anyone. I wasn't sure if the rather stark contrast between the rich emotion of Lord Nantwich's old diaries and the senile, muddled form he took during the present-day of the narration was intentional or not. Nantwich never caught on with me, he seemed so blurry and not-there; but as I said, maybe that was the point, Hollinghurst wishing to remind us that complex submerged past lives lie beneath the vague blandness of manner exhibited by the elderly. The samples of Nantwich's diaries can be heartbreaking, especially the scene in prison when he's told of Taha's murder by a smirking warden, and the recounting of the subsequent torpor and despair. It's all so well done. I haven't been struck like that in a long time. And the old home movie of Ronald Firbank walking down an Italian road had me gazing wistfully out the window. The account of the film felt rather tacked-on and random, but it was also one of the more sad and memorable things in the entire book. Amazing how he does it. I'm so happy that Hollinghurst has two more novels that I have yet to read. He and Richard Yates are my revelations of 2008. \n", u'\n           \n           Este que foi o seu primeiro romance publicado valeu a Alan Hollinghurst o pr\xe9mio Somerset Maugham em 1989. \xc0 semelhan\xe7a de A Linha da Beleza, n\xe3o se trata de um romance para o qual antevemos \xe0 partida um final bomb\xe1stico, na verdade, obriga o leitor a adquirir um ritmo mais lento, pelos cap\xedtulos demasiado longos e demora dos acontecimentos.

The content is not organised chronologically, but by theme. The information is presented as discursive essays, with each chapter spanning decades or even centuries, sometimes covering more than one topic. Some chapters are better than others.Winroth often challenges the veracity of long-held views of the Vikings and their practices putting them down as \u201ccreations of a vivid imagination of the high medieval writers\u201d. He presents interesting theories based on the latest archaeological evidence; the sections on the \u201cFarm beneath the sand\u201d and Osberg burial site were fascinating. I also found the chapter on economy and commerce well explained with the parallels between East and West carefully analysed.Though the content is extremely interesting and well researched, the author\u2019s style is somewhat dry. I overall enjoyed reading this book but I would not recommend it on its own to someone who is not already familiar with the subject. 3.5 stars.Favourite quotes:Viking Age emigration from Scandinavia was not driven primarily by population pressures at home, as is often imagined. Populations always tend to grow, but such growth is typically balanced by famine, war, and disease, as Thomas Malthus (1766\u20131834) postulated. People may always feel pressured by the lack of opportunity at home; what made the Viking Age different was not exceptionally great pressures at home but the appearance of real opportunities elsewhere.It mattered that the Vikings brought into circulation silver and gold that had been hidden away in ecclesiastical treasure-houses, but we must not exaggerate the impact. Church plate had always been taken to mints and melted down when a bishop, an abbot, or a king needed cash, so it was never permanently withdrawn from the economy when placed in a treasury. More important for the early medieval resurgence of commerce in western Europe was the central Asian silver that Scandinavian merchants brought to Europe.Although no exact statistics are available, it seems that Scandinavians and others who exported slaves, fur, and other articles to the Arab Caliphate and Byzantium rectified for some time the lopsided trade balance between western Europe and the East, stopping or perhaps even reversing the flow of silver and gold that had been leaving the western economy. The influx strengthened the European stock of silver, the coinage, and thus commerce. It was during the Viking Age that the European economy slowly began to grow again, eventually, in the modern era, leading to Europe\u2019s economic, political, and cultural hegemony.Their power over people extended so far that they could no longer maintain the kind of personal friendships that the gift economy of previous centuries promoted. Instead, they needed military and administrative structures to run what increasingly looked like older European kingdoms. The Church was the best organized institution in Europe at the time, and kings received help from clerics to build up their royal administration. Chieftaincy based on charisma and friendships yielded to organized and administrative kingship, although for a long time both \u201csystems\u201d existed in parallel.\n', u'\nAnders Winroth delivered exactly what I expected in his book The Age of the Vikings, but he also delivered a little something more, and it was the surprise of that that little something more that filled me with a hint of wonder, rekindling my dreams of my career that never was.Winroth\'s overview of the Viking Age was broken up into precisely the categories I hoped, addressing the stereotypes and our shared knowledge of what the Vikings were with a desire to dispel the myths and mistakes embedded in the knowledge we think we have. For instance, his discussion of our vision of the Vikings as bloodthirsty raiders takes on the witnesses who have passed this image down to us by analyzing much of the overlooked evidence that points to countless motives that go beyond mere bloodlust, and uncovering the many times the Vikings turned their ships around and went home when they were paid off by the "targets" of their raids. Then he takes his argument a step further, pointing out that much of the reports of Viking savagery come from the priests living under the incredibly bloody -- and genocidal -- reign of Charlemagne (a man celebrated today for his enlightenment despite the enormous death toll he amassed).This deconstruction of our perceptions is at the heart of Winroth\'s history of the Viking Age, and it reveals that theirs was a culture of complexity, flexibility and durability that was much, much more than a band of violent raiders, pillagers, and plunderers. But then there is that extra little thing that Anders Winroth delivers in The Age of the Vikings. It has to do with a commentary on history (and the places from which history draws its evidence -- archaeology, literature, religion, anthropology. Winroth\'s unstated thesis is that ultimately we just don\'t know the way things were, in any age, and we can\'t. All of our sources are biased, or speculative, or flawed, and that maybe the best any historian can do is eliminate things we know a time was not. That and give the best guess without pretending it is an absolute truth. This idea brought me back to my sideways love of archaeology, of my desire, long held but never acted upon, to become an archeologist. And right here, near my home, I have one of the richest Viking finds connected to a school I love\'s archaeology department, and maybe 45 is not too old to just go ahead and start digging in the wet, cold soil and turning my speculative mind to the evidence of a thousand years ago. I like that. I like being reminded of those paths long overgrown but always waiting to be returned to.\n         ', u'\n           \n           This is a very academic text, and I think that\'s the explanation for the mediocre ratings. Ironically, the popular misconceptions that Winroth seeks to dispel with his book are likely what makes this book disappointing to some.I welcomed the academic treatment of the subject, though I admit it was a bit dry at times.He covers the culture and economy as well as the military/political history of this fascinating people and the period of time. They were a fearsome and complicated people, worthy of the respect and fear they inspired. On the other hand, they were not exceptional in their ferocity - they were a violent people in a violent time. They are cast as the "bad guys" because most of the written source material was written by the people they raided and not the Norsemen themselves.What else is good? His explanations of the various sources and their limitations; the discussion of their poetry and art; and his coverage of religion. The last is particularly difficult given that almost all the material we have on it was recorded by Christians a century and more after nearly all Scandinavia had converted to Christianity. The Christians were more interested in consolidating variations instead of preserving them separately, and, once consolidated, harmonizing them with Christian material.Overall, a 3.5/5. I\'d go with 4 if it was a bit more engaging. Other than that, the factual material is great and it\'s presented well enough.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Probably the only reason I did not give The Age of the Vikings by Anders Winroth five stars is that I dearly love the Icelandic sagas, which are mentioned only in passing in this book.Where it succeeds is in giving an excellent picture of the Vikings on the Scandinavian mainland, where my previous knowledge concentrated on Iceland, which I have visited twice. In addition to concentrating on mainland Scandinavia, it also concentrates on the Viking culture prior to the conversion to Christianity (which would account for skipping the mostly 13th century sagas). For literature, that leaves only fragments of skaldic poetry that have come down to us from the sagas and from runic stones.\n', u'\n           \n           It was very thorough, & so sometimes tedious reading. However there were many interesting things to learn. Much has been learned from poems & writings that were written at time of their happenings. Also the burial grounds taught much about their lives & stations in life by things buried with them. Also the Rune stones while very, almost secretly, relaying about the people buried there. There was a huge acknowledgements section, also a large Bibliography & note section for the entire book.

These invaluable, sometimes previously unknown works are of particular interest to scholars and researchers.<br /><br />European Literature, 1790-1840: The Corvey Collection includes:<br /><br />* Novels and Gothic Novels<br />* Short Stories<br />* Belles-Lettres<br />* Short Prose Forms<br />* Dramatic Works<br />* Poetry<br />* Anthologies<br />* And more<br /><br />Selected with the guidance of an international team of expert advisors, these primary sources are invaluable for a wide range of academic disciplines and areas of study, providing never before possible research opportunities for one of the most studied historical periods.<br /><br />Additional Metadata<br /><br />Primary Id: B0370601<br />PSM Id: NCCOF0063-C00000-B0370601<br />DVI Collection Id: NCCOC0062<br />Bibliographic Id: NCCO004600<br />Reel: 2410<br />MCODE: 4UVC<br />Original Publisher: Chez Auguste Boulland et Cie, libraire<br />Original Publication Year: 1824<br />Original Publication Place: Paris<br />Original Imprint Manufacturer: Imprimerie de Huzard-Courcier<br /><br /><br />Variant Titles<br /><br />Cri de la faim<br /><br /><br />Subjects<br /><br />French fiction -- 19th century.', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'12704593', u"The Sutter Buttes: A Naturalist's View", u' ', u'\n270875\nWalt Anderson\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/270875.Walt_Anderson\n3.90\n21\n2\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'2', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'19278571', u"On the Reception of the 'Origin of Species'", u' ', u'\n17171\nThomas Henry Huxley\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1390055976p5/17171.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1390055976p2/17171.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17171.Thomas_Henry_Huxley\n3.68\n696\n43\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'13', u'4.50', u'4', [], [], 0]!!!![u'35949394', u'Sibylline Leaves (Classic Reprint)', u' ', u'\n17084432\nCharles Agustus Ballough\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17084432.Charles_Agustus_Ballough\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2017', u'7', u'20', u'Forgotten Books', u'Excerpt from Sibylline Leaves<br /><br />Twain said in one of his stories if you want to know how the weather was see Genesis, first chapter, \'and it rained forty days and forty nights.\'<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The complete opposite of Jasmine, her emotionally unstable baby sister, London has worked hard to stay out of the spotlight. Then she discovers that Wade, one of the most popular guys in school, is gay like her and their new-found closeness based around their shared secret has half the student body convinced they\'re hooking up...and a lot of girls aren\'t happy about it. Now she\'s been dubbed "Dirty London." Rumors are flying about her inability to keep her clothes on, and London is pretty sure she\'s developing a crush on the one girl who sees through it all. If she could admit why stealing boyfriends is the last thing on her mind-not to mention find out what\'s going on with Jasmine and her rapidly disappearing psych medications-her life would be a much brighter place.

I\'ll be honest, I didn\'t really expect much \u2014 I\'m not the biggest fan of YA stories, especially set in high school, and this didn\'t initially sound like the most interesting thing ever to me, but now I\'m so very glad I read it.I wish it had been longer, not because I felt things were rushed at all, just because I would love to read much more about these characters.If there\'s one thing Dirty London reminded me of, it\'s that high school is hell and straight teenage boys are the devil. Oh, and girls are freaking incredible. The main character is a serious badass, and it clearly runs in her family \u2014 London, Jasmine and their mom were such fantastic characters. The sisters\'s character development was so interesting, both individually and in regards to their relationship. At first I was mad at Jasmine for how she treated London regarding school, but god, I can\'t hold it against a teenage girl for how she deals with the nightmare that high school can be.And London was so damn brave and ridiculously selfless. I loved how feminist her character was; her thoughts about what was going on with her, how she reacted to invasions of her privacy and men harassing her and knew that none of it was ever her fault, her fierce defensiveness and appreciation of her mother, her determination to keep her head high when awful people were throwing slurs at her; (view spoiler)[even when girls were literally attacking her for things she didn\'t do, she immediately felt bad for them because of how they were treated by the boys they liked (hide spoiler)].Amber was just delightful. I liked how natural the beginning of her relationship with London felt; there was no typical love-at-first-sight stuff, London had a crush on someone else when they met, and slowly fell for her as they got to know one another and the quiet girl from drama club turned out to be the one who saw London for who she truly was more easily than anyone else at school.I could talk for hours about how much I liked every single character who wasn\'t an asshole. I\'m also glad that, despite the relatively dark topics, this book never really felt hard for me to read \u2014 as in, emotionally draining or upsetting. That was probably because of how great London\'s narration was. She was so damn determined to just get through everything that was happening to her. And she was straight up hilarious in lighter moments ("God, I have to get my head on straight. (Hahaha...ha.)").Frankly, I have no complaints. This was a pretty great read.\n         ', u"\nActual Rating: 4.5 starsDirty London is included in Young Adult Hollywood's \n23 LGBT YA Books You Should Be Reading.\nThis book is delightful, authentic with lots of things to offer. It has a strong emphasis on coming of out, as well as sexual identity, fantastic feminist movement, sister/family/friendship love with a little bit swooning.Dirty London easily become one of my favorite books this year. Mini review to come.\n         ", u"\n           \n           Really loved this book. It's pretty rare for a YA to have a MC who is so self aware as London is. It's refreshing. The sister arc was well done. The beard arc was pretty cool too. Dunno. I guess I really just liked London. She's a cool person. \n         ", u'\n           \n           Kelley York\'s books have all been on my to-read list for a while, and I\'ve even bought one, but I just hadn\'t gotten to read any yet. Then I saw she\'d released an f/f romance, and had to give it a shot. I ended up enjoying it a lot. In London, York\'s crafted a character who\'s a delightfully realistic mix of seeming contradictions - she wants desperately to blend in, but she\'s also fiercely strong. She consents to a plan that involves pretending she\'s straight, but she also never wavers in her confidence of her self-identification and what she wants. She\'s emphatic about keeping her father out of her life, but she\'ll go to any lengths for her mother and sister. I would\'ve loved more of a feel for "every day London" - even in first person, she felt somewhat distant, I think because her narration always seemed to be bouncing off other people or who she used to be. (For instance, she designs costumes, and may even want to go into costume design, but she sort of just produces them - we don\'t really see her studying fabrics or sketching or anything to suggest this is an actual passion, what her headspace gets into then, etc.) But on the whole, I found her engaging, bold, and real, and one thing I really enjoyed about this book was that I felt like we were really watching her earn all the relationships in her life; York really does show how and why some deepened, some weakened, and some just changed, as relationships are wont to do. This is a relatively short book, and I could\'ve stood to see some fleshing out, particularly of the ending, but it\'s by no means an unsatisfying read. From the romance to the family dynamics to the issue of slut-shaming to the coming out narrative, Dirty London has definitely ensured I\'ll be reading the rest of York\'s books, and hoping she writes more f/f soon. \n         ', u"\n           \n           I was super disappointed in this book! I read a really positive review by \nCayce\n, so I immediately bought it (although of course I did not immediately read it because I have a problem with reading books I actually purchase).The first thing I was disappointed in was the main character, London. Even though this is told from first person POV, I was extremely detached from her the whole time. It was a little weird, since first person is usually so immersive, but it just wasn't in Dirty London.The second is how assumptive London was regarding Wade. She saw him at an LGBT festival, and immediately assumed he was gay. GIRL, you should know that you can't assuming anything. There is no (or should be no) default, remember? And this was just such an example of bisexual erasure, and I was equally parts pissed and disappointed.The third is how dramatic the whole thing was. Douchey jock, and bitchy girls. It was like watching a teenage soap opera, and I found it all a little too over the top for me, to be honest.Unfortunately, Dirty London wasn't really for me, and I'm still looking for a lesbian YA book that I love.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'26009261', u'Scharia f\xfcr Nicht-Muslime', u'82', u'\n84721\nBill Warner\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/84721.Bill_Warner\n4.23\n560\n69\n', u'2015', u'7', u'28', u'Smashwords Edition', u'Islam ist sowohl Religion, als auch ein politisches System mit seinen eigenen Gesetzen genannt Scharia.

It delivers on its claim that to know Islam, one must know Sharia Law. Islam is a totalitarian ideology meaning that every aspect of a Muslim's life is regulated. Sharia is the politics of that ideology. Islam's code of law and its administration is, therefore, Sharia Law. That law is, according to the Quran, perfect because it is from Allah. Sharia Law is as it was hundreds of years ago. The friction apparent with Islam is due to its ultimate mission of converting everyone to it. The only options, other than conversion, are dhimmitude (slavery), or death. The concentrated effort to realize this mission in undertaken by a minority of Muslims who society brand as radicals, extremists, fundamentalists, or, more specifically, Islamists.The West must learn about its enemy to prevent being overtaken without a shot being fired. Islam knows its enemy because the Quran tells them it is all Non-Muslims. Islamists use the host country's laws and culture against them to overpopulate and become the majority culture in that country. They may feign assimilation, when necessary, but most simply demand the host country change to accommodate Muslims and Sharia Law. Eventually, Sharia Law becomes the law of the land and the country is, then, a Muslim nation.Sharia Law for Non-Muslims by Bill Warner of the Center for the Study of Political Islam, is all one needs to understand what all the commotion is about. Without this knowledge, Islam is unstoppable with its jihad tactics of swarming immigration, lying, deceiving, and, like a fox, befriending its prey to gain the confidence of target host nations.\n", u"\n           \n           It explaines Islam and it's connection to Sharia law as a political system that is Islam.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'16967877', u'Characters of the Crucifixion', u'144', u'\n1390492\nRobert Wilkerson\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1390492.Robert_Wilkerson\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2011', u'4', u'12', u'Winepress Publishing', u'Looking at the characters that crossed paths with Jesus on His way to the cross reveals how people today can have a closer relationship with Christ.', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'25265242', u'Ashanti Lilies', u' ', u'\n13123810\nShirley Ginger\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13123810.Shirley_Ginger\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u"On leaving school 18 year old Jennie reluctantly accompanies her parents to Ghana, West Africa which has just become independent from colonial rule.

Catherine and Heathcliff are monstrous. Monstrous. You won't like them because they are unlikable. They are irrational, self-absorbed, malicious and pretty much any negative quality you can think a person is capable of possessing without imploding. They seek and destroy and act with no thought to consequence. And I find it fascinating that Emily Bronte chose them to be her central protagonists.When this was first published it was met with animosity because of how utterly repugnant these two characters were. The way they go about their business caring nothing for others but themselves was enough for me to shake my head in complete and total judgment, as if Catherine and Heathcliff could see me and are then effectively shamed by their actions. Wuthering Heights is epic, in my humble opinion, because I believe that the scope of this story is monumental. Let me explain: it is a simple tale between two families that are bound in such a way that their fates are irrevocably linked. What affects one, affects the other. Its about Catherine and Heathcliff who fall in love and how their relationship ruins the lives of those around them. The book, all 400 pages of it, occur almost entirely at Wuthering Heights, the estate of the Earnshaws, and at Thrushcross Grange, the estate of the Lintons with only a couple of miles of land in between.And yet it is not a small story.The emotional magnitude of this book is great and far reaching. The provoking and unapologetic quality of Bronte's writing is seductive. The process of reading this story can feel so masochistic sometimes that its almost if she's daring us to stop reading and throw the book away. Like its a game of personal endurance to see how much we can take, how far we can go. She pushes at us, challenging us and all the while knowing that we have to keep reading because redemption awaits. It is nothing like its contemporaries. The moors, the darkness of the moors, that curses the household of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants is ever present. Nature is personified. It is its own character; its there, lingering and simmering ever so quietly, saturating every scene with its silent threats of doom...okay, I have to stop talking like this...what am I anymore?There is poison in this book, but let me ease your mind by saying that it is balanced with goodness also. This isn't a perfect novel. There were still moments I found myself in perplexion (recently invented word). And while everything about Catherine and Heathcliff may be corrupt, there is hope in Wuthering Heights. If you can journey through the menacing forest of Emily Bronte's imagination, do it because the view is something to behold.Ha ha ha, this review...what even is this?\n         ", u"\n           \n           I've tried it three times. I know people are obsessed with it. I hate everyone in the book - and I just can't care about a book where I actually hate the characters.And, sure, I get the interpretation that as terrible as Heathcliff and Cathy are, it's their love that redeems them, and isn't that romantic.No.\n         ", u'\n           \n           This is my favourite book. I do not say that lightly, I\'ve read quite a lot from all different genres and time periods, but this is my favourite book. Of all time. Ever. The ladies over at The Readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for Wuthering Heights off my chest in their "Year of the Classics" feature, but I now realise it\'s time I posted a little something in this blank review space. I mean, come on, it\'s my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness.So, what do I love so much about Wuthering Heights? Everything. Okay, maybe not, that wouldn\'t really be saying it strongly enough.What I love about this novel is the setting, the wilderness. This is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety, this is the tale of people who aren\'t so socially acceptable, who live away from the strict rules of civilization - it\'s almost as if they\'re not quite from the world we know. The isolation of the setting out on the Yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of The Heights and Thrushcross Grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms, how unconventional they are, and how lonely they are.This is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters, readers who don\'t have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding them and their circumstances. People are not born evil... so what makes them that way? What torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth? What kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again? Heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness, Emily Bront\xeb simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured, to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness, to his adulthood as an angry, violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger Cathy in order to make her marry his son.It would be so easy to hate Heathcliff, and I don\'t feel that he is some dark, sexy hero like others often do. But I appreciate what Emily Bront\xeb attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression. Heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates, by being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else. And Cathy is no delicate flower either. What hope did Heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was a selfish, vindictive, little wretch? But I love Emily Bront\xeb for creating such imperfect, screwed-up characters.This is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated individuals, but I think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through Cathy (younger) and Hareton\'s relationship, and the suggestion that Cathy (older) and Heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife. I had an English teacher in high school that said Cathy and Heathcliff\'s personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next. I have no idea if this was something Ms Bronte intended, but the romantic in me likes to imagine that it\'s true.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Certain novels come to you with pre-packaged expectations. They just seem to be part of literature\'s collective unconscious, even if they are completely outside of your own cultural referents. I, for instance, who have no particular knowledge of--or great love for--romantic, Anglo-Gothic fiction, came to Wuthering Heights with the assumption that I was picking up a melancholy ghost story of thwarted, passionate love and eternal obsession. Obsession turned out to be only accurate part of this presumption. Having an image of Heathcliff and Cathy embracing \nGone with the Wind\n-style on a windy moor ironed in my mind, I was almost completely unprepared for the hermetic, moribund, bleak, vengeful, perverse, and yes--obsessive--novel that this really is. Don Quixote is not about windmills and Wuthering Heights is not really a love story. Heathcliff and Cathy\'s love affair (if it can be called that) is a narcissistic ("I am Heathcliff!" Cathy exclaims at one point), possessive, and imminently cruel relationship predicated on self-denial and an obsessiveness that relies not on passion, but rather borders on hatred. They are selfish, violent, and contriving people who have borne their fair share of abuses (mostly Heathcliff in this respect) and in turn, feel no compunction about raining similar abuses on those who they find beneath them.Given this dynamic, it seems perhaps inevitable that these two characters would make not only themselves miserable, but everyone around them miserable--even after death. This is particularly easy to accomplish mainly because there are--with the exception of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant who rents a home from Heathcliff--no outside characters. Everyone in the novel (including the servants) is isolated, trapped between the same two homes, with the same two families, and have truly no chance of escaping any of the events and repercussions that occur.(One character makes a temporary escape, only to suffer all the more for it later.) More important, however, is the fact that Heathcliff and Cathy don\'t even need be present (although they usually are in some fashion) for their influences to be felt by the other characters. The sins of the father, are literally, inherited and distributed among the next generation. The children of Wuthering Heights are not only physical doubles of their parents (At least 3 characters look like Cathy, and one resembles Heathcliff), but they are also spiritual stand-ins. They must suffer for past transgressions, and they must find a way to make amends for them. All, I might add, without the particular benefit of ever having the full story, the context that might be necessary to actually change their circumstances. Misery, it seems, is inevitable. There is, of course, much more to be said about this novel. One could spend quite some time dissecting all the various repetitions and doublings, the narrative structure (the story is told by the housekeeper to the lodger who then writes it down as a diary entry), or the archetypal analogies and semi-biblical symbolism that seems to be implicit to every part of this story. The point being, I suppose, that while Wuthering Heights may not be the wistful romance one (or maybe just I) expected to be, it is a particularly satisfying one for all of its dark and layered surprises. \n         ', u"\n           \n           I never expected this book to be as flagrantly, unforgivably bad as it was.To start, Bronte's technical choice of narrating the story of the primary characters by having the housekeeper explain everything to a tenant 20 years after it happened completely kills suspense and intimacy. The most I can say is that to some extent this functions as a device to help shroud the story and motives from the reader. But really, at the time literary technique hadn't quite always gotten around to accepting that omnipotent 3rd person narrators are allowed, so you'd have to have a multiperspective story told by an omnipotent 3rd person narrator who was actually a character in the story (e.g. the housekeeper Ellen). The layers of perspective make it annoying and sometimes impossible to figure out who is telling what bit of story; and moreover, because so much is related as two characters explaining things between themselves, the result is that we rarely see any action, and instead have the entire book explained in socratic, pedantic exposition.The sense of place is poorly rendered and almost entirely missing. Great, the moor is gray.But ultimately, the most damning thing is that the characters are a bunch of immature, insuffrable, narcissistic assholes with very little self respect. This isn't a story of great love and passion. It's the story of how child abuse perpetuates itself through the generations. The characters are either emotionally abused as children or, as in the case of Cathy I, they're spoiled and overindulged with no discipline and can't muster the restraint and self-respect to ditch abusive relationships. I kept waiting for any of the characters to be remotely worth my time, but I found no respite from the brutish abuse of the horribly twisted Heathcliff or from the simpering idiocy of Cathy I and II. Ugh. Not only are there no transformations or growth, but the characters aren't even that likable to begin with. How this book got to be a classic is beyond me. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'21156780', u'Drawing Attention: How to unleash the incredible power of cartoons in marketing, advertising, sales promotion, job search, VIP contact campaigns and more', u' ', u'\n5046356\nStu Heinecke\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5046356.Stu_Heinecke\n3.86\n74\n11\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'Cartoons are the best-read and best- -remembered part of magazines and newspapers, and the most powerful involvement device ever invented.

A part of that might be that he and/or his love interest are captured and break free a ridiculous number of times in this book. Add in the "romantic misunderstanding" elements and I became somewhat fed up with those tropes.

On the supply side, China also exports live bovine excluding purebred breeding animals. Which countries receive the most exports from China? How are these exports concentrated across buyers? What is the value of these exports and which countries are the largest buyers?

With the globalization of this market, managers can no longer be contented with a local view. Nor can managers be contented with out-of-date statistics which appear several years after the fact.

Modern wheat depends on synthetic fertilizer and herbicides that damage our health, land, water, and environment. Fortunately, heritage 'landrace' wheats that evolved over millennia in the organic fields of traditional farms do not need bio-chemical intervention to yield bountifully, are gluten-safe, have rich flavor and high nutrition. Yet the robust, majestic wheats that nourished our ancestors are on the verge of extinction.<br /><br />In <em>Restoring Heritage Grains</em>, author Eli Rogosa of the Heritage Grain Conservancy, invites readers to restore forgotten wheats such as delicious gluten-safe einkorn that nourished the first Neolithic farmers, emmer--the grain of ancient Israel, Egypt, and Rome that is perfect for pasta and flatbreads, rare durums that are drought-tolerant and high in protein, and many more little known wheat species, each of which have a lineage intertwined with the human species and that taste better than any modern wheat.<br /><br /><em>Restoring Heritage Grains</em> combines the history of grain growing and society, in-depth practical advice on landrace wheat husbandry, wheat folk traditions and mythology, and guidelines for the Neolithic diet with traditional recipes for rustic bread, pastry and beer.

Andrei, a hospital doctor, and Anna, a nursery teacher, are forging a life together. They try to avoid coming to the attention of the authorities, but their private happiness is precarious.

They are not even separate. The past is alive, waiting. [...] It claims what is its own. Rarely have I read a novel so effective in evoking the feeling of Stalinist Russia; the suffocating, overwhelming paranoia of a place where everyone is alert to dissenters, saboteurs, and enemies of the state, where people are willing to inform on those around them to save themselves, or just to improve their own situation. Dunmore builds the uncertainty, watchfulness, and selfishness into the very bones of her story, making her two main characters, Anna and Andrei, stand out all the more. Perhaps it was this dichotomy that made them seem unreal to me, but they were almost too perfect: self-sacrificing, brave, hopeful. Again, this may say more about me than them, but where I could imagine all the other people in the novel with real clarity, these two were just too good to be believed. The book offers them as a symbol of enduring love, able to persist even in the most difficult of times, a confidence well at odds with their daily lives and gut wrenching enough in the climate of the novel to make the reader sick with worry for them. It was masterfully done by the author, each word chosen for emotion and impact. Her death this year was a sad loss, but i'm thankful that it brought me to her works.\n         ", u'\n           \n           A marvelous read. Soviet Russia comes to life in all its paranoid complexity, seen through the eyes of one achingly poignant family: an idealistic young doctor and his quiet wife, both survivors of the Leningrad siege and its appalling starvation. All they want is to enjoy the tiny pleasures of life allowed by the state, and build a life together . . . but the wheels of power have a way of grinding people like this into paste, and they both know the danger they are in when the young doctor is called upon to treat the mortally ill son of a very powerful party member. If the boy dies, an entire family may be wiped out in casual retribution, and everyone knows it. I was flipping the final pages with my heart in my throat, deeply terrified for the fate of one small fictional family.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Despite the Booker long-listing, or maybe because of it, I approached this one with some trepidation. I\'ve never read any Helen Dunmore, and I remember being put off by a review of Mourning Ruby that called it "like a Russian doll" - too literary for me, I thought, and I\'ve never touched her stuff since. So I pick this one up, and then find it\'s a sequel to The Siege, which I haven\'t read - but don\'t be put off by that, I wasn\'t, and it worked perfectly as a stand-alone. And I now have a new author to add to my list of favourites and acquire the entire back catalogue - this book was quite superb.Set in 1950s Leningrad, in the last days of Lenin, we encounter Andrei the paediatric doctor, his wife Anna who works in a kindergarten and Anna\'s young brother Kolya. These are good people in a loving household, and against the extraordinary tension and oppression of the last days of Lenin we watch them doing the ordinary things of life - weekends at the dacha, eking out the food, arguing with neighbours, meeting friends, dressing for a dance. When Andrei finds himself leading the hospital treatment of the dying son of Volkov, a chief of the secret police, the world comes crashing down in a way that makes you want to do something about the unjustness of it .The characterisation is superb, major and minor characters alike - even Volkov, whose anger, fear and irrationality can almost be understood. The tension throughout the book is palpable - this is a world unlike anything we\'ll ever know, cold for reasons other than the ubiquitous snow, where no-one can be trusted and freedom\'s an illusion. And it\'s a truly excellent read - the author has a lovely flowing poetic style (in a good way) that makes you want to read on. And although The Betrayal paints a vivid picture of the political scene, this is a really touching personal and emotional story about ordinary individuals who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n         ', u"\n           \n           Very well written, and delicately drawn -- suspenseful and evocative without being over the top in its depictions of Stalin's depravities (Tom Rob Smith, I'm looking at you). It's an interesting combination of suspense and historical drama with really thoughtful writing that focuses more on the small details than on the big reveals.  The central love story is compelling and realistic, and the other characters are economically drawn but memorable and real as well. I found the suspense almost painful at points - because I cared about these characters. I think I would have been a bit at sea as to who everyone was and why I cared if I hadn't read The Siege -- this should be more explicitly marketed as a sequel. And I'd love to read another book about this family...\n         "], 0]!!!![u'32851221', u'\nWhat About Wickham? (The Curse of Clan Ross #4) by L.L.

She writes about emotional situations that people anywhere can understand and relate to on one level or another. If I was to go out on a limb I would say Done Grown Up is the stronger of the two books because the characters are so well developed and feel instantly familiar.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Done Growed Up (Apron Strings Trilogy) by Mary Morony is a sequel to The Apron Strings. I did not have the opportunity yet to read the first book in the Trilogy, but even without having done so did not take away the pleasure of reading it. I found this book to be successful because if like me you have not had the chance to read the first, you will not become lost, or not be able to understand the contents. The author starts off giving you a \u201crefresher\u201d of sorts on the Mackey Family and where they all are now, and right there makes it a successful piece on its own. You may not know their whole story, the details that may have lead them into certain predicaments, but as you read forward it all unfolds making successful stand alone if you don\u2019t get the chance to read the other two. Growing up in a time during the Civil Rights Movement was a difficult time for many, and the hardest on the black community, but the stress and fears, the woe\u2019s and challenges were faced by many even outside. It was faced by those who supported the civil rights movement, their families, the young followed the adults blindly not fully understanding how serious it really was, some followed it with a sense of entitlement while others fought hard to make a difference for themselves, their families and future generations to come. The time of the Civil Rights Movement was a time of segregation. Separate stalls, separate water fountains, separate schools and to you it may seem trivial since it has always been option but for those who lived through it black or white, for those who saw how it really was, how hard and petty the people and government was, the right to sit where you feel free to, front or back is a very big deal. Author Mary Morony knows something about the times when segregation, racism, bigotry, disloyalty and lack of trust was at its prime. When getting a divorce was a unspoken, tainted word that should not even be brought up in a civilized conversation. Mary Morony was able to weave the good, the bad and the ugly into her novels and evoke emotions about a time that has yet to be long forgotten. Inspired by the families housekeeper, Mary Morony drew from her own personal experiences along with those of a woman who would become her best friend, that held her up when it seemed there was no hope left to be found in a home of a broken family. She found solace in her words but she could never be seen out with her, go the movies, dinner, a casual strole or even sit on the bus together.Done Growed up ( Apron Strings Trilogy) is fictional tale about the Mackey family but the emotions you will feel are real. The author is able to weave a beautiful and complicated tale full of emotion because as you read it feels like you are there with them experiencing there ups and downs, there highs and lows. There is so much depth to Moronys characters its hard to believe that they are fictional and not a living breathing person right in front of you. For me, what I find best about this story, is its not hard to see it becoming a classic one day, a book read in English class during black history month. The story will remain relevant for decades to come and a reminder of behind every corner for every one bigoted ,racist fool, there are two more who want to and will embark on making a difference. Cause no matter how hard we try, racism will exist, but we can keep working on one day making it the scary story we tell as reminder, and not one that has to be lived, one day...\n         ', u'\n           \n           I might be a little biased.

I think. I can\u2019t be sure, as I don\u2019t listen to much rap (few 41 year-old men should say \u201chip-hop\u201d) anymore. Let me explain. I have long admired Jay-Z\u2019s effortless delivery and the joy with which he seems to embrace his talents; he sounds like he knows he\u2019s good, values his craft, and enjoys the hell out of what he does. And although William Gibson is quieter and, uh, more Canadian, I felt the same way about the author while reading Zero History.After the have-to-admit-it-was-kind-of-a-letdown Spook Country, Gibson proceeds with Zero History as if he has a (nerdy) chip on his shoulder. He sparkles in detail and rhythm, interspersing long, wraparound sentences with short, noiresque dialogue. The characterizations are taut and durable. This book\u2019s natural partner, both in theme and quality, is Pattern Recognition. In both novels Gibson scythes through cultural static and creates a present that, while swirling all around us, seems just beyond our comprehension. I don\u2019t want to make this novel sound like homework. Reading Gibson, when he\u2019s on point, or anywhere close to on point, is exhilarating. Throughout Zero History he blends thematic depth with intricate industrial espionage and, thank God, reads as if he\u2019s locking in on whatever it is that makes him so excellent. He, like the self-proclaimed greatest rapper alive, makes it look easy. I don\u2019t know from what roborant Gibson\u2019s been drinking, but more, please, don\u2019t stop now. The flow between the three \u201cBigend\u201d books (Zero History is the third of a trilogy) troubled me. I read both Pattern Recognition and Spook Country so long ago that I felt as if I were missing, from faulty memory, subtle links between the novels. Listen. You\u2019ve probably already formed an opinion on Mr. Gibson. If you like his work you\u2019ll understand when I say Zero History is one of his best. If you\u2019ve never read Gibson start with Pattern Recogition and work your way through the trilogy. Although I doubt he\u2019d be so bold as to speak up on his own, he\u2019s one of the greatest writers alive.Also, Tad RULES for getting me an autographed copy (inscribed to me!) of Zero History. I am forever in your debt, sir.\n', u'\n           \n           The Devil Wears Prada meets James Bond.The third in his Blue Ant series, published in 2010, William Gibson\u2019s Zero History is not really a part of a trilogy, the three books all being only loosely connected, and yet this is the one in which he most completely defines his subject.More about keeping secrets than advertising, Huburtus Bigend is the artful dodger of Gibson\u2019s man-behind-the-man-behind-the-man fashionable psychological thriller. Gibson is able to intricately describe how drug value is as much about prohibition as about the effect. The cant of making something valuable is as simple as Economics 101 supply versus demand and yet Gibson is able to focus our attention into a narrow, laser like forced perspective of the psychic roots of international cool.Gibson\u2019s narrative style is tightly wound yet exhibiting laid back sophistication. The real key to his successful story telling is his unique ability to describe great detail with a minimum of narration. His attention to detail is impeccable and this adds to the quality of his storyline.William Gibson shares his backstreet London bacon and eggs brunch with the world\u2019s most interesting man and he was wearing Klein blue.\n', u'\n           \n           After about page 100, I told Nicola that this book was about an insane search for awesome jeans, but that Gibson is clearly out-of-the-loop because he thinks exclusive jeans might sell for 200 Australian dollars. Yesterday, she tells me what she thinks happens in the book (without having read any of it):"A designer decides to make a pair of jeans out of a magic carpet. They are one-of-a-kind, and priced accordingly: $250. Obviously they only appeal to multi-millionairesses."One day, such a multi-millionairess walks into the shop and falls in love with the jeans! However, the jeans are a size 6 and she wears a size 12. She buys them anyway, in spite of the exorbitant price, but then succumbs to bulimia while trying to slim down to fit them."The jeans are willed to the woman\'s niece, played by Anne Hathaway. Hathaway is a size zero or something, but she really wants to wear the magic flying carpet flying jeans, so she starts bulking up.

This time, he wants her find out who designs a particularly underground clothing label. Assisting her will be Milgrim, the ex-junkie who can translate Russian (this is seriously his only skill, but given that Hollis has no skills at all, it's a step up). They wander Europe on Blue Ant's obscenely expansive expense account asking people about the clothing label. This is literally the entirety of their plan: to walk up to other clothing designers and ask them if they know about this underground label. Over and over again. It doesn't result in much plot or dialog, but it does give Gibson an excuse to describe, ad nauseum, the outfit of every single character in every single scene. Around page 300 Gibson seems to recollect that books require plots, and randomly there's a kidnapping. Hollis and Milgrim are, as in everything, useless in getting their kidnapped colleague back. Somehow, Hollis's boyfriend turns up with a plan. Random coincidences occur, everyone speaks in clipped non-sequitors, and the kidnapped colleague gets free. I never knew what was happening or why I should care, nor did I like any of the characters*, no matter how cool their haircuts and boots (although apparently their hair and boots are very cool indeed. Gibson expends a great deal of effort and page space reminding us of this). It's a terrible, dull book. Gibson was known for his prescient views of the future, but given that every page is a list of brandnames, his current stories will seem dated very quickly. Skip this series.*Actually, I quite enjoyed Heidi, Hollis's former drummer and a physically fearless bad-ass.\n         ", u'\n           \n           AllI can say is that this review written by someone else, is spot on!By Viking (Los Angeles USA) - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What\'s this?)

It seemed foolhardy; even everybody knows you can\'t win the war on crime. But Bratton delivered. In an extraordinary twenty-seven months, serious crime in New York City went down by 33 percent, the murder rate was cut in half--and Bill Bratton was heralded as the most charismatic and respected law enforcement official in America.. In this outspoken account of his news-making career, Bratton reveals how his cutting-edge policing strategies brought about the historic reduction in crime. <br />Bratton\'s success made national news and landed him on the cover of Time. It also landed him in political hot water. Bratton earned such positive press that before he\'d completed his first week on the job, the administration of New York\'s media-hungry mayor Rudolph Giuliani, threatened to fire him. Bratton gives a vivid, behind-the-scenes look at the sizzle and substance, and he pulls no punches describing the personalities who really run the city. <br />Bratton grew up in a working-class Boston neighborhood, always dreaming of being a cop. As a young officer under Robert di Grazia, Boston\'s progressive police commissioner, he got a ground-level view of real police reform and also saw what happens when an outspoken, dynamic, reform-minded police commissioner starts to outshine an ambitious mayor. He was soon in the forefront of the community policing movement and a rising star in the profession. Bratton had turned around four major police departments when he accepted the number one police job in America. <br />When Bratton arrived at the NYPD, New York\'s Finest were almost hiding; they had given up on preventing crime and were trying only to respond to it. Narcotics, Vice, Auto Theft, and the Gun Squads all worked banker\'s hours while the competition--the bad guys--worked around the clock. Bratton changed that. He brought talent to the top and instilled pride in the force; he listened to the people in the neighborhoods and to the cops on the street. Bratton and his dream team created Compstat, a combination of computer statistics analysis and an unwavering demand for accountability. Cops were called on the carpet, and crime began to drop. With Bratton on the job, New York City was turned around. <br />Today, New York\'s plummeting crime rate and improved quality of life remain a national success story. Bratton is directly responsible, and his strategies are being studied and implemented by police forces across the country and around the world. In Turnaround, Bratton shows how the war on crime can be won once and for all. "From the Hardcover edition."', u'88', u'4.13', u'46', [], [u"\n           \n           A very interesting read for those interested in how the Americans do policing and how the leadership differs in contrast to the UK. More so, very interesting to see how much of an impact one man can make to a system of policing that was already so well-established. There are few, dare I say it, 'revolutionaries' like Bratton in the world of policing. Most, particularly in the UK, are moulded into politicians and afraid to 'rock the boat' with drastic reforms; Bratton is certainly a departure from these types of leaders. It is worth noting that Bratton's 'Turnarounds' were arguably centred in a different generation of policing - where resources were plentiful, set against today's age of austerity, but nonetheless, a very inspiring read for those in service. In particular, I would suggest relevant and accessible for those aspiring to leadership roles who are yet to be tainted by the inevitable cynicism (a point which Bratton eloquently discusses). As with most autobiographies, it does suffer one-sidedness but having said that, there is nothing more in other literature (besides the controversy over the book deal itself), that suggests what Bratton writes is misleading. His account of his time as NYPD Commissioner is particularly intriguing and demonstrates just how politicized policing in Western cultures has become. What sets Bratton aside from so many other police leaders is that he never seems to forget where he's come from and speaks constantly about the regard and respect he has for the officers that do everyday frontline policing. Indeed, one could argue that his entire leadership style is Branson-esque in the way that he keeps his officers and staff happy which in turn delivers crime reduction and public confidence. A brilliant read.\n         ", u"\n           \n           If you are interested in law enforcement this book is a great guide that shows you the success stories inside of the NYPD. It gives critical information on how William Bratton reduced New York's murder rate by 50% in just two years. Every police officer should be forced to read this book in order to steer them towards a successful career in crime fighting that works with the community rather than against them.\n         ", u"\nDecent book, with some good insightsI was hoping for a better read, but it wasn't that bad either. For the modern police leader, this book does have some valuable insights into the dangers of politics encroaching into the everyday operations of a PD. Altogether a worthwhile read.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'19122491', u'Idyllen', u'88', u'\n1665\nTheocritus\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1357462234p5/1665.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1357462234p2/1665.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1665.Theocritus\n3.82\n471\n24\n', u'2013', u'3', u'13', u'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', u'<b>Theokrit: Idyllen</b><br /><br />Edition Holzinger.

Indeed it\u2019s impressive the list of personalities that they have figured so far in the introductions to each The Sandman TPBs, and having Stephen King here is even more impressive.I mean... WOW!!!Maybe my only humble critique is that when the Master King did a comment about how The Sandman is a comic book series suggested to mature readers and that if the readers wouldn\u2019t understand the stories, they should get back to Spider-Man, X-Men or Fantastic Four. Honestly I didn\u2019t like (one little bit) that comment, for two reasons: One, clearly he only mentioned Marvel titles, what? All DC material is so adult oriented?! Sure, I was amazed how \u201cmature\u201d was the brawl showing none strategy against Darkseid in the first storyach of New 52\u2019s Justice League. Geez! And Two, I wonder if he ever heard of materials such as Spider-Man: Kraven\u2019s Last Hunt, X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills or even a single issue like #267 \u201cA Small Loss\u201d from Fantastic Four?I love DC AND Marvel, AND Indy comic book houses too, so I don\u2019t like when it\u2019s made a direct comment attacking the competition without need. I don\u2019t need to choose. I don\u2019t need to limit myself only choosing certain publishing house, franchise or literary genre.It\u2019s nobody\u2019s secret that many comic books aren\u2019t those great literary masterpieces, but hardly all prose novels have always a depth content. It\u2019s not something about the writing format but about the writers. And in any case, sometimes we aren\u2019t looking for a mature material to make us to mediate and to expand our intellect, sometimes we are in the mood of just want to read about a brainless brawl against a intergalactic tyrant, without looking to expand our understanding of the universo but just to relax a while.That\u2019s the magic and beauty of books, any kind of books, there are enough for any kind of reading that we wish to do, depending of our mood, our situation, our available time, etc...\nDoes everyone have a drink? Good. So... let my auditors feel themselves transported far, far from here to lands far distant...\nLike some other previous volumes in this run of The Sandman, this TPB is a collection of short stories, even the collection is so shaken (but not stirred) that you will have short stories inside of the short stories, I mean, you are reading a short story and before you know, you\u2019re reading another short story but inside of the current short story.There are some similitudes (about elements, but definitely new stories) from the developed in the sixth volume Fables and Reflections since cities and \u201cemperors\u201d will be pivotal in this totally new selection of tales.You will visit cities even more ambitious about its surreal ambiances, abandoning for good the realms of Earth (or maybe not?) but definitely out of the ordinary.The reality storm is coming...But no, you won\u2019t be involved in the taking of any throne, no, but you will visit a very special inn (even amazing enough not the only one of its kind) where you can be safe from \u201creality storms\u201d and the price for your beverage and food is as cheap as a story.But that doesn\u2019t mean that they are cheap stories, oh no, imagination have no boundaries and when the tales are \u201cconstructed\u201d with \u201cbricks\u201d of dreams, you can be sure that \u201creality\u201d while may be storming out there, but you will be warm enough inside having the comfortable blankets of fantasy around you.\nSir? Who are you?\n\nJust one with an\u2026 interest... in tales. ... ...I am Prince of Stories.\nThe name of the inn is \u201cThe World\u2019s End\u201d. I guess that Simon Pegg (the actor) read this TPB, since there is a movie with the same title and it\u2019s referring too about an inn, maybe not as astonishing as the one in this TPB but definitely not normal either. (By the way, I didn\u2019t like much that movie since I found it too similar the angle to the done in the wonderful Shaun of the Dead also made by Pegg.)An odd detail about the illustration work was there is a character named Cluracan who is a male fairy, and he wears pointed ears on the scenes inside the inn, but when he appears in some stories, while he is a fairy and everybody knows that he is a fairy so there isn\u2019t any point to hide it, the artists assigned to those other section didn\u2019t draw him pointed ears.You can be sure that Morpheus, our dear Death, and other regular characters from the series, they appear here, and while some apparitions are clear in the opoen, even you will have to be quite observant to realize at some moments that you are meeting them.Obviously, since this is The Sandman, dreams are a pivotal element once again, here, in these short stories, where you will meet all kind of dreams, from the general American Dream to others kinda more individual.And maybe, just maybe, a grim glimpse of things to come in the series...Whose tale is next?\n', u"\n           \n           And so we get our first taste of the infamous House of Mystery, the harbor at World's End, where safety and drink in the limbo between dimensions can be bought with the price of a tale.I'm pretty fond of these short stories, but perhaps not as fond as I was the first time I read them. They're solid and thought-provoking, but not overly so.I suppose what really got to me was the end of the volume. The wake. *shiver* Okay, that was some seriously deep shit. When death looked at us like that? Oh lordy that was great. Sometimes the art gets it right, and this one? Yeah. It gets it right.*shiver*I LOVE great foreshadowing. :)\n         ", u"\n[9/10]Brief Lives proved to be a hard act to follow. I found myself re-reading some of the single issues in this following album in order to fully enjoy them, after an initial lukewarm reception. I was sucked back in after a while, as connections with the overall plot become evident, and as the framing story linking together the individual tales ended with a promise of troubled times ahead for the Endless.This framing story is a familiar device, of strangers seeking shelter from a storm and passing the time until the weather clears by telling stories. A couple is driving at night from L.A. to Chicago, when they are caught by a Blizzard in July, crash the car and end up at the Inn of the End of the World.It's a popular technique since the Decameron and the Canterbury Tales, up to the more recent Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy or the lyrics to Hotel California: Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before 'Relax' said the night man, 'We are programmed to receive. You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!'  The Inn is full of exotic travellers, marooned here by a 'reality storm' : a mysterious cataclysmic event that has reverberations through all the realms of the Sandman Universe. Over an ale or two, these journeymen share something of their past experiences: When a world ends, there's always something left over. A story, perhaps, or a vision, or a hope. This inn is a refuge, after the lights go out. For a while. Here they are: A Tale of Two Cities :  Is there any person in the world who does not dream? who does not contain within them worlds unimagined? Told by Robert, a clerk in a big building, in a big city. He is comfortable in his routine job, and his greatest passion is to explore his surroundings : During his lunch hour he would wander the streets of the city, at night again he roams the streets: lights, sounds, reflections in the water.This is the story that gave the most trouble, as I was put off by the minimalist graphic art, despite it's art-nouveau, German Impressionist inspiration. After a couple of re-reads, I came to appreciate more what Gaiman is driving at: one of his favorite urban contemporary themes of people falling through the cracks of reality and ending up in an alternate universe ruled by magic and peopled by bizarro, grotesque misfits. I was reminded strongly of my earlier read this year of  Neverwhere  . Dreamers are particularly prone to this type of slippage ( In the subway train, in the morning, he would read a newspaper and wonder what would happen were the subway carriage suddently to be transported to a distant planet: how long it would take before the passengers began to speak, one to another; who would make love to whom; who would be eaten should they ran out of food. ), and Robert ends up one day on the other side of the mirror, where his adventures take a turn towards horror. Gaiman declares in an interview that he tried here to pay homage to the classic H. P. Lovecraft stories of sleeping Gods, and his writing, as usual, rises to the occasion, carrying the story forward regardless of the artwork.  Perhaps a city is a living thing. Each city has its own personality, after all. Los Angeles is not Vienna. London is not Moscow. Chicago is not Paris. Each city is a collection of lives and buildings and it has its own personality. So, if a city has a personality, maybe it also has a soul, Maybe it dreams. --- Cluracan's Tale  : Cluracan appeared before in the series, as one the Faerie nobles delegated to negociate with Morpheus the ownership of Hell. His choice of story is a sword & sorcery high fantasy adventure, along the lines of Robert E Howard. Once again, Cluracan is an ambassador from the Queen of Faerieland to an ancient city where he falls afoul of its current dictator. Morpheus has a cameo, as in the first story, but the main actor remains the bragging, flamboyant and vengeful Cluracan: I resolved to do the best I could. With all the resources and craft and glamour I possessed, not to mention a certain amount of malice. An entertaining issue, but not one of my top picks.--- Hob's Leviathan  : by contrast, the third time lucky pick, may end up as one of my top five favorites of the whole Sandman collection. After Lovecraft and R E Howard, it is the turn of Joseph Conrad to serve as inspiration to a sailing adventure. Jim, a runaway youth with salt water in his veins, describes his voyage from Singapore to London on a barquettine named Sea Witch. He meets at the beginning another returning character, Hob Gadling - the man who tricked Death ans keeps coming back through the centuries to have a drink with Dream. A stowaway on the ship has his own story to tell, an Arabian Nights fable of fakirs, jealous rajahs, unfaithful wives and the curse of mortality. Great stuff! Among other things, it made me want to read a book mentioned by Hob:  Saltwater Ballads  by John Masefield. Another reason for loving this issue in particular is the artwork by Michael Zulli, clear and detailed, reminding me of the French and Belgian schools. The Golden Boy  Is a modern fable about an alternate America were young people start to vote at 18 and elect one of their own for President. This golden Boy refuses to enter into dealings with the corrupt Old Guard of politicians, and brings about world peace and prosperity. Gaiman mentions some relation to The Watchmen comics, but I failed to notice them. More clear are some biblical references, with a Smiley man as the Devil tempting the Golden Boy.Another so / so issue.---  Cerements  is my second favorite choice of the album, 'une danse macabre' of black humour and dark omens for future developments in the series. The narrator is Petrefax, an apprentice mortician. He tells the story of Lithargis, a city dedicated to the art of disposing of dead bodies, of the strict rules and traditions to be observed and of the surpsising link between the necropolis and the Endless.--- World's End Closes the cover story of the Inn at he End of the World, and of the nature of the reality storm. The less I talk about it, the better chance I have of not spoiling things for new readers. I'll just mention that it made me want to start on book 9 immediately.\n         ", u'\nThis eighth entry in the series is, like Dream Country, a collection of individual tales only tangentially connected to the characters and concerns of the series. Gaiman, in a brief afterward, tells us that he crafted these stories to take advantage of the talents of some of his favorite artists, and in this he has succeeded admirably. The visual styles are pleasantly varied, and many of the individual images are haunting and memorable.The tales are presented to us through a Decameron style frame story: a diverse group of people gather at an inn for shelter and safety, and tell stories to pass the time. This time, though, they are not avoiding the plague but a \u201creality storm,\u201d an event that disrupts the lives of people living in many historical periods and different dimensions, and consequently the tellers of these are an extraordinarily diverse group.I particularly enjoyed \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d (a \u201cMr. Gaheris,\u201d traveling through his own city, finds himself in a dreaming city similar yet different from his own) for artist Alec Stevens\u2019 modernistic, one-dimensional images which give to Gaheris\u2019 cities a contemporary yet dreamlike reality. I also enjoyed very much \u201cThe Golden Boy\u201d (an alternate United States in which an eighteen-year-old named \u201cPrez\u201d follows Dick Nixon as president and does very well) and \u201cCerements\u201d (a series of tales told by the masters and apprentices of the necropolis Litharge, who discuss their work among the dead), but the other two tales were also entertaining, as was the resolution of the frame story itself.All in all, a worthy contribution to the series. \n         ', u'\nHistorias dentro de historias, dentro de historias, dentro de historias\u2026 Perdidos por una tormenta un par de amigos llegan a La Posada del Fin del Mundo, donde descubren que no son los \xfanicos que se han perdido, ya que existen personas y seres de distintos mundos, \xe9pocas y dimensiones, todos sentados esperando que pase la tormenta para regresar, \xbfy qu\xe9 mejor forma hay para pasar el rato que contando historias?

The central thesis is that humanity has self-willed the ecological crisis in order to bring about the necessary conditions for transcendence of our current state of being, by undergoing an initiatory ordeal on a planetary scale. This collective ordeal is necessary for us to evolve from one state of being - our current level of consciousness - to the next. By passing through this initiation we realize ourselves as one unified being, a planetary super-organism in a symbiotic relationship with the Earth's ecology and the entire web of life. Covering everything from energy and agriculture, to culture, politics, media and ideology, Pinchbeck's book is ultimately about the nature of the human soul and the future of our current world. He calls for an intentional and consciously designed metamorphosis of our current systems. which transform capitalist and exclusive structures into participatory, democratic, and inclusive ones, based on an integration of Eastern metaphysics, social ecology, and radical political thought.", u'312', u'4.24', u'41', [(u'to-read', 208)], [u'\n           \n           Can the human race survive? That is the question addressed by this book.I\u2019m not sure when I started thinking that we were doomed. Perhaps some time in the 1980s. It seemed obvious to me. We have an economic system dependent on ever-increasing levels of growth, which means ever-increasing consumption of material goods and energy, the production of which are eating away at our ecological life-support systems. Even before there was much attention being given to climate change, it was clear that we were headed toward a metaphorical cliff, and the fact that very few people, at the time, seemed to want to acknowledge it made it seem as if a solution was unlikely. Then, as now, I tried not to think about it too much, but it hung like a black cloud over my head.Pinchbeck, after much inner-exploration with psychedelic drugs, has come to the belief that we have unconsciously brought this crisis upon ourselves as a way to motivate ourselves through the process of a dramatic metamorphosis as a species - that it is our initiation by crisis into existence as a specie organism - a fully-integrated global society. A similar idea has been expressed by Bruce Lipton and Steve Bhaerman in their book Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (Hay House, 2009), which he credits as an influence.One of the problems with the ecological crisis (not to mention associated humanitarian and economic crises) is that they inspire feelings of fear and guilt in many of us. Fear and guilt can be paralysing emotions. How are we to be motivated to act? Those who would motivate us flood us with scary facts, but these just make us feel more frightened, guilty and hopeless, and so we turn off and seek some form of comfort in more materialism or superficial escapism.What we need more than scary facts is hope. We need a vision of how something can be done. And Pinchbeck does a great job of outlining such a vision. Of course he can only sketch in the broad outlines of what is possible. He\u2019s not a specialist in energy systems or farming or economics. He has to point us in the direction of those who can help us in these areas.This is a consistently fascinating book. Pinchbeck\u2019s hyperactive mind and personal, indeed sometimes confessional, approach ensure that. But I didn\u2019t find it an easy book to approach. There is a bitter comfort in putting things in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d basket. I start to read that I should give up eating meat and minimise buying new products and a large part of me says, \u201cLet the planet burn. Let the innocent people die. I\u2019m not going outside my comfort zone.\u201d And I don\u2019t even drive a car. What is the response likely to be from those who live far outside the bounds of ecological limits? I\u2019m reminded of Matthew 19:24 \u201c\u2026it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d There\u2019s no room for excess baggage aboard the specie individual.What is at the basis of this stubbornness? When faced with a challenge, sometimes we grasp it enthusiastically and sometimes we put our head in the sand. I don\u2019t want it to be implied that I\u2019m not a good person. That isn\u2019t what Pinchbeck is saying, but it is how it feels. And how it feels is what matters to motivation. Why does it give us pleasure to do things which deep down we may feel we shouldn\u2019t? Why does the rich celebrity who travels to Africa and sees people living in poverty (and does some charity work there), nevertheless live in a ridiculously ornate mansion? In our insecure state there is a kind of relief to be found in defying what our conscience tells us we should do. This is also the lure of the forbidden. Are we going to squirm in humiliation beneath the bully who says \u201cYou mustn\u2019t!\u201d or are we going to feel the power and release of screaming \u201cI will!\u201d To my mind this is the key impasse to the realisation of the kind of plan that Pinchbeck puts forward. His emphasis on the spiritual underpinnings of the transformation acknowledge this, but I think that there are aspects of this psychological dimension that need to be understood more clearly.The cultivation of unconditional self-acceptance will need to provide the grounding for change. A fully self-accepting individual need not experience a call for a change in their lifestyle as a condemnation. It is through unconditional self-acceptance that we unleash our capacity for the love of others and thus provide a basis for true community. Without this there is a danger that a spreading cultural imperative to adopt an ecological lifestyle might manifest itself in a toxic culture of eco-shaming, equivalent to some of the examples we see today where political correctness has taken a particularly hostile form - decentralised authoritarianism in which individuals take out the frustration of self-imposed discipline by victimising anyone who doesn\u2019t do likewise, or doesn\u2019t appear to be doing likewise. A healing evolution has to be motivated by warm and generous feelings.I suspect that some may be very nervous about Pinchbeck\u2019s references to Marx and calls for a post-capitalist economic system. The problem is that we\u2019ve seen capitalism bring us rapid technological development and an increase in material comfort for a larger proportion of the world\u2019s population. And we\u2019ve seen an alternative - communism - produce most of the worst horrors of the 20th Century. Capitalism\u2019s success was riding on temporary trends. Now it\u2019s in trouble. Can we transition to something which suits our needs better while avoiding the catastrophe that was communism? Again, I think a lot hinges on the psychological. Has capitalism worked well because it accommodates our selfishness, allowing that selfishness to be the motive engine that drives it, or is our selfishness a product of capitalism? Are we encouraged to want more and compete more because the system doesn\u2019t foster a sense of community which would be counter-productive to it? Of course the two are not mutually exclusive, but I think new economics will be more likely to succeed if the insecurity of ego which lies at the heart of our selfishness is healed.Pinchbeck also examines the subject of sexuality. Is our materialistic consumption partly fed by pervasive disappointment in our erotic lives? Are we meant to be monogamous? I think this is an important subject to look at. It\u2019s been a troubled area for Pinchbeck himself. But when we repress any aspect of our being we also end up repressing our capacity for openness, honesty, spontaneity and generosity - our capacity for love. So if we are going to have a community which functions more smoothly and productiveness, it needs to be one which knows what to do about erotic desires as an alternative to repressing them. There is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all answer to this, something which Pinchbeck acknowledges.When it comes to spirituality, Pinchbeck really throws it all in. He even touches on reincarnation, clairvoyance, tele-kinesis and astral travel. (David Icke\u2019s lizard men get a mention to.) This may lose him credibility in the eyes of many, but he does provide a lot of food for thought for the open-minded. Do these things seem more credible to someone who has taken ayahuasca? Maybe. Since I\u2019m not prepared to take some of these things with a handful of magic mushrooms, I\u2019ll take them with a grain of salt, but it is important to acknowledge that he is only presenting these things as \u201cmaybes\u201d and the fact that he has a very open minded on these subjects doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of the bulk of what he has to say. I think he is right that we will need something similar to the religious spirit - a shared vision of something greater than ourselves to unite and motivate us.He places a lot of importance on the media as a possible way of generating fast change. If new trends spread like wild-fire across television and social media, why not the enthusiasm for this rescue mission along with all the information we will need to bring it about? And look at how the propaganda effort turned around U.S. society to fight World War II. It has to be said though that it is easier to appeal to our hedonism, our paranoia about germs crawling around our bathroom or our latent aggression and xenophobia, than it is to genuinely inspire us toward a community effort. We need autonomous individuals, not sheep, but with that caveat aside I think he is right that both mass and social media can provide us with the network we need to share practical skills and information as well as the kind of vision Pinchbeck provides us with in his book - one of a bright future that yet may be.\n         ', u'\n           \n           So Completely Timely: A Hopeful Outlook in this Chaotic Mess of Contemporary LifeAuthor/journalist/philosopher/visionary Daniel Pinchbeck comes from a family of artistic parents who in the 1970s and 1980s helped open Daniel\u2019s eyes to an alternative vision - his father was abstract painter Peter Pinchbeck and his mother, Joyce Johnson, a writer/participant in the Beat Generation. Daniel has served as a journalist for Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, the Village Voice, Rolling Stone, among other periodicals and currently is the editorial director of the Evolver Project (a global network connecting organizations and individuals working toward the health and wellbeing of Earth and humanity. The Evolver Network\u2019s mission is to empower positive transformation of self and community through education, celebration, and co-creation). Daniel has stated \u2018In my late twenties, I fell into a deep spiritual crisis that led me to the study of shamanism and psychedelic substances. My first book, Breaking Open the Head, recounted my initiation into several tribal cultures that use hallucinogens in their rituals. Over time, I became convinced of the legitimacy of the shamanic and mystical worldview held by indigenous peoples around the world.\u2019 While the masses in this country \u2013 and globally \u2013 cringe at the enormously destructive signs of the times in leadership and environmental changes and frightening dichotomy between the haves and the have nots, Daniel Pinchbeck looks beyond the daily increasing clutter of the world today and offers insights that give hope that, in the well state words of Ira Israel \u2018we can break through our current blockages, activate our social imagination, and create a post-capitalist, post-work utopia. Overcoming limited greed and self-interest, we can design a resilient global civilization that works for everyone and not just the 1%. Pinchbeck believes that we have the technical ability to live harmoniously in a new paradigm and it is only our social systems and fractured ideologies that stand in our way of accepting our role as responsible stewards of Gaia.\u2019Daniel focuses on the individual acceptance of the realities of now so that collectively we may evolve into a force for correcting the ecological downturn and our current political and economical broken and severely in need of change. He calls for an intentional redesign of our current systems, transforming unjust and elitist structures into participatory, democratic, and inclusive ones. His viewpoint integrates indigenous design principles and Eastern metaphysics with social ecology and radical political thought in a new synthesis.Inspiring and challenging reading, but we who are absorbing his pr\xe9cis are the ones who must make the changes if we are to survive \u2013 and Daniel is convinced survival and growth are indeed feasible. This is a book that deserves or rather demands wide readership for all of us. \n', u'\n           \n           Exceptional Book! Out of the box thinking throughout. This is about the best primer on where we are in the planetary crisis, with lots of pursuits to get us through it. All without meaningless platitudes.\n         ', u"\n           \n           A solid 3.5 stars. While I admire and appreciate Pinchbeck's unflinching optimism I feel that he misses the reality of human nature. I agree that there is much we can learn and adopt from tribal cultures, however, he paints broad strokes - seemingly missing the point that many tribal cultures embodied the same environment destroying practices and violence that Western civilization is practicing today. I do agree that the problems we are facing are primarily spiritual in nature but I find that many of Pinchbeck's proposed solutions are flights of idealistic fantasy and nothing more. Of course it's hard to criticize him for it- he seems well aware of his idealism. He's right more often than he's not but he is strongest when he sticks to reality based facts. While I do believe that humanity's nature is primarily good solving the problems we've created for us will require the calamity that Pinchbeck is hoping to avoid. All in all a fun read (as always from Pinchbeck) with good information. The author's audacity to hope and dream is to be commended.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I highly recommend this book.

Her eagerly-awaited new book features an irresistible blend of stories from her life as a Broadway and Hollywood star combined with her lifelong search for spiritual clarity and meaning. Full of personal anecdotes and reflections, MacLaine confronts the realities and rewards of growing older, looking back at where her journey has taken her and coming to a greater understanding of her own place in the universe. Full of her trademark wit and candour, this new book explores a wealth of issues ranging from nutrition and health to what happens to us after death. It is sure to delight her legions and fans and fellow travellers everywhere.', u'688', u'3.66', u'424', [(u'to-read', 168)], [u'\n           \n           I love Shirley Maclaine. I think she\'s delightfully outrageous, a real individual, and a phenomenal actress (ever see Turning Point?). I have always found her books to be entertaining. But this one is different.As I "mature" I can really appreciate a good ramble. I enjoy a glimpse into the workings of the mind, the skips and jumps they make in their thought process, the associations. That\'s why I enjoyed this book. It\'s a bit of a soap box rant on extraterrestrials. So if you\'re not interested in that subject (but, geez, life on other planets? who wouldn\'t be?) you won\'t like this book. It\'s not the adventure that "Camino" was. It\'s not a tale; it\'s a reflection. My guess is that young readers will find it a bit confusing, while those of us who are beginning to reflect on our lives, our passions, and our unanswered questions will find it intriguing.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Shirley Maclaine wrote this book while in the midst of moving into a new residence overlooking Santa Fe in New Mexico, and reverts to the theme of settling into the house at the start of each chapter. This acts as her grounding so to speak, although the house is perched high in the mountains.She covers many topics in the book - her life and famous friends, advice for healthy living, her past life in Atlantis, UFO sightings and information, philosophical and spiritual reflections on the origins of life and historical evidence of visitors from the skies, the so-called star people, dating rom past ages. These star people were called "gods" due to their being greatly more advanced than the earth dwellers, and it turns out that the Old Testament God "Jehovah", may actually not have been a god but a star person. (Jehovah was a jealous, vengeful god, unlike the loving God that dwells within us all referred to by Jesus in the New Testament.)The first chapters are extremely readable, while the chapter on UFOs, which is packed with information, is somewhat long-winded. There is however no doubt about the veracity of this information. The author is seemingly friends with all the top people in the world, including former presidents and other heads of state, and even the physicist Stephen Hawking. She has thus had access to otherwise "secret" or withheld information.As indicated in the title, the author seems to get wiser and wiser as she ages. This is not surprising, since she is continuously seeking information and asking questions, as well as pursuing her spiritual development.Moreover she never hesitates to say what she thinks or believes in, no matter what this is. This is one of her most admirable qualities.She concludes the book by drawing our attention to the approaching final year of transformation, the end of a cycle of 25,000 years, including other cycles, according to the Mayan calender. This year is 2012, when "our new consciousness will be born".I strongly recommend this fascinating book to all those seeking the "truth".\n', u'\n           \n           I think Shirley MacLaine is a fascinating individual and a very good writer, especially when she is describing personal experiences. In this one, unfortunately she spent most of the book talking about the experiences of others that she feels support her far from mainstream beliefs. I love her openness to new ways of thinking and viewing the world and always respect her honesty. But she is far less compelling when she is trying to support her perceptions of life with references to what she perceives other people to believe. I miss the Shirley of her first three books. That Shirley described, vividly, her own fascinating experiences and allowed you to take them or leave them, without feeling a need to provide supporting references. I love Shirley the open-minded observer and seeker. I am less taken with the pseudo scholar, who\'s "supporting evidence" causes me to question what I was willing to accept as a first-hand account.Like the earlier Shirley, I am willing to keep an open mind about things beyond my understanding and enjoy learning where other people\'s experiences have led them. So I will continue to read books that challenge mainstream thought processes as well as those that challenge alternative thought processes.\n         ', u"\n           \n           My Age-ing Father gave me this book over a year ago where it sat on my shelf, un-read and avoided. Finally I reluctantly decided to read it after all, some of his questionable recommendations in the past have been better than initially anticipated. However this book was not in that category. I forced myself through the first few painful chapters before finally deciding to have mercy on myself and quit. Maclaine writes in a disordered fashion, skipping from one unrelated topic to the next, leaving you wondering where the topic, or story line is. It is as though she sat down and typed every random thought and memory that came into her head and then published the book without revision or editing. Her writing lacks grace and depth, and I wouldn't recommend putting yourself through it. Sorry Dad. \n         ", u'\n           \n           I am genuinely intrigued with Shirley MacLaine and have read quite a few of her books. Sage-ing While Age-ing had me interested in parts and overwhelmed in other topics. I felt that I was able to relate to her concept of synchronicity having felt myself that I have been in a certain situation before it occurred. As far as aliens, UFOs and other "visitors from outer space" I have difficulty accepting these notions. It was interesting to hear about the seven chakras because I do believe in the healing powers within ourselves. Overall I did gain some interesting perspectives but there were parts where I felt she was too far "out on a limb".\n         '], 0]!!!![u'28506635', u'A Comprehensive Guide on the Tarot and Its Cards', u' ', u'\n8341809\nJ.D.

A beer company was holding eliminations for its yearly glamour girl contest, and models swarmed over the thick rugs, accompanied by press agents and photographers. All of the models looked the same.

By now, the major characters have all been introduced and we are comfortable with their back stories and personalities. Despite McBain\'s original intentions, Steve Carella has emerged as the first among equals in the lineup, and the series now has a "settled" feel to it.As the story opens, a con man is working the streets of Isola, McBain\'s fictional city where the series takes place. Citizens are being cheated out of sums large and small and then, in a very unsettling turn, a woman\'s body floats to the surface of the Harb River. She\'s been in the river for about four months, making an identification very difficult. About the body\'s only distinguishing feature at this point is a small tattoo, drawn into the space between the victim\'s thumb and first finger.With no real leads to follow, the detectives of the 87th Precinct are virtually stymied in attempting to find the killer. Then another woman\'s body is discovered in the river and she has a variation of the same tattoo between her thumb and first finger. Steve Carella now has the first hint of a clue and as he pursues a very clever killer he suddenly also has a very personal stake in stopping the Con Man before he claims his next victim.This is a quick, fun read that will whet the appetite of any McBain fan for the books that follow.\n         ', u"\n           \n           Several years ago Amazon put the 87th Precinct novels that have been released in kindle format on sale & I bought a ton of them. This is the second one I've read, and I primarily decided to delve into the backlist because I read a wikipedia article about Scandinavian Noir that suggested that one of the pioneering writers in that genre was influenced by McBain's 87th Precinct novels.Stylistically, these are very different from modern police procedurals, with very stripped down language and character/narrative arcs that don't extend beyond a single book. I'm interested to read a few more to see how McBain's style changes over the years that he was writing his series. They are also a bit of a period piece, with limited access to forensic evidence, no computers to assist in identification/investigation, and detectives who are universally male, and on the hard-boiled side. It would feel like cliche, except that McBain is convincing.\n         ", u"\n           \n           The year turns and another 87th Precinct book breezes through. It's April in Isola. The cruellest month? Cruel enough anyway as the con is well and truly on. McBain relishes in his chosen theme. The con and the conmen themselves get a thorough going over by McBain's philosophically edged examination. The detectives of the 87th are trying to reel in a couple of tricksters who are working their way through the confidence trick handbook, fleecing the rich and poor for a fortune or a dime. Arthur Brown and newly promoted Bert Kling are hitting the streets trying to luck out for a lead on the pair. But it's Steve Carella who discovers a far more sinister and deadly conman at work. The river deals him a woman, dead for some time, a tattoo of a heart encircling the word MAC almost hidden on the flesh of her hand and a mysteriously emptied bank account. As ever the characters are great and becoming more familiar by the book. With the investigations waiting for that one killer lead, McBain revels in dangling them in front of the wrong eyes at the wrong time. Some of it gets dangled by our eyes too through print outs of missing persons reports, Criminal identity cards and, somewhat indecipherably, dental records. Carella is recently back from his honeymoon with new wife Teddy who is deaf-mute. This one works up to a particularly suspenseful finale with Teddy aiding in the investigation. \n         ", u'\n           \n           These early Ed McBain novels from the 1950s are now old enough to qualify almost as historical mysteries and the language and attitudes often seem staid, stilted, and outdated. Did policemen really used to talk like that? I remember watching reruns of "Dragnet" years after the series first ran and I seem to recall that Sgt. Joe Friday and his partner did, in fact, employ some of this terminology and exhibit some of those attitudes, so, yeah, I guess maybe they really did talk like that. In spite of the fact that the books feel dated, the writing is so crisp that it draws us in and holds our attention. We feel like time travelers visiting another planet and observing the interaction of the inhabitants there. The books never fail to spark our interest and this, the fourth in the 87th Precinct series, is the best one yet, I think. Each entry has been an improvement upon the last one, which bodes well for my future reading of the series.This story begins with a con man cheating people out of their money, some small amounts and some more substantial. The cop assigned to this case takes that personally and pursues his quarry with a vengeance.Meanwhile, a con man of another and much more sinister sort plies his trade through personal ads in magazines. His goal is to reach lonely women and, after bilking them out of whatever money they may have and convincing them to get a tattoo which he tells them will mark them as his, he poisons them with arsenic and dumps their bodies in the river.But bodies dumped in the river, even when they are weighted down, don\'t always stay there. And so, the Isola police and Precinct 87 are the unfortunate recipients of a "floater," a badly decomposed body that comes to the surface after being in the water for at least three months. Detective Steve Carella and his partner Bert Kling are assigned to the case and start trying to establish the identity of the dead woman, whose only clothing consisted of a bra and who had no identification, and to work out how she came to be in the water.Before they can solve the first murder, yet another "floater" turns up. The cause of death turns out to be the same - arsenic poisoning - and the woman has a similar tattoo. It looks as though Isola may have a serial killer on its hands.The tattoos turn out to be the definitive clue which helps to break the case, along with the help of a conscientious citizen tattoo artist named Charlie Chen. The Con Man lets us get to know Steve Carella a little better. We also see his wife, Teddy, playing an important role in finally tracking down this con man/murderer. Apparently, they will continue to be at the center of future mysteries in the series.By this time, McBain had really perfected his technique of writing a scintillating beginning to his tales, one that hooks you from the first sentence and keeps you turning pages. It\'s easy to see why other writers of mysteries, particularly of police procedurals, acknowledge him as the master.\n'], 0]!!!![u'34807586', u'Perpetual - The Series (Perpetual Darkness & Perpetual Spring)', u'24', u'\n5823132\nJanna Hill\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1492568375p5/5823132.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1492568375p2/5823132.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5823132.Janna_Hill\n3.35\n130\n32\n', u'2013', u'12', u'19', u'Feet on Fire ', u'Perpetual Darkness is told from the man\u2019s perspective; this is his side of the story.

This idea, once controversial, is now supported by science, and has become widely popular among therapists around the world. In HOLD ME TIGHT, Dr. Sue Johnson presents Emotionally Focused Therapy to the general public for the first time. Johnson teaches that the way to save and enrich a relationship is to reestablish safe emotional connection and preserve the attachment bond. With this in mind, she focuses on key moments in a relationship-from Recognizing the Demon Dialogue to Revisiting a Rocky Moment-and uses them as touchpoints for seven healing conversations. Through case studies from her practice, illuminating advice, and practical exercises, couples will learn how to nurture their relationships and ensure a lifetime of love.', u'10907', u'4.10', u'4106', [(u'to-read', 3933), (u'currently-reading', 707), (u'non-fiction', 117), (u'psychology', 107), (u'relationships', 92), (u'self-help', 80), (u'marriage', 52)], [u'\n           \n           Dr. Johnson\'s book easily wins the "World\'s Worst Title Ever" award. "Hold Me Tight" qua self-help book title evokes, in this reader, all the wrong associations. Much as does the scent of patchouli oil and as does the sound of gauzy-eyed adults whispering for their inner child to come on out for a good old back rub, "Hold Me Tight" evokes (again, for this reader) scary New Agey associations. For example, "Hold Me Tight" made me recall against my will that Kenny Loggins dumped his first wife in order to marry his colonic therapist. In a nude wedding ceremony. Nude, as in, everybody in attendance, guests and minister (excepting, hopefully, his clerical collar) included, sans sartorial stitch one. Nothing wrong with the concept, I guess, but who wants to see Mr. Danger Zone, singing, nakedly, to his new wife "Cut foot-loo-zah! Cut foot-loo-zah!"Nothing against the New Age, per se, but everything against Kenny Loggins. That man\'s music has done way too much harm for him to ever have hope of redemption.The foregoing may indeed be a strange preamble for the review of a book I thoroughly enjoyed, but I kind of feel like I needed to say what I felt about the title. Because many people who feel like I do about touchy-feely New Age hand-holding might otherwise bypass a truly remarkable and helpful book."Hold Me Tight," contrary to whatever negative images or atavistic longings its title triggers, is a phenomenal book. Dr. Johnson is part of the EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy; again, sorry for whatever horrible associations this phrase conjures) movement. EFT espouses spousal connection and intimacy over technical communication proscriptions and mars-venus feelings flowcharts. Unlike most traditional "get along with your spouse" theories, EFT actually works real wonders.I could go on, but I won\'t. If you seek to communicate more meaningfully with your spouse, fight your feelings and look past the bad title and read "Hold Me Tight."\n         ', u'\n           \n           The application of attachment theory to adult romantic relationships is genius. According to Johnson, the need for attachment underlies the conflict involved in the pursue-withdraw dance that couples often get locked into, a dance she aptly metaphorizes as the Polka. Her work provides tools for couples who want to stop dancing the Polka and start doing a Tango, her language for a relationship that allows for deep connection.\n         ', u'\n           \n           amazingly barfy language used to convey truly fascinating and revelatory concepts regarding interpersonal relationships and the dynamics you find within them. i was able to get past the awful self-help style and diction and get to the heart of what she\'s saying--basically applying bowles\' attachment theory to adult partnerships, and putting forth the idea that it is not only normal to need other people (esp your partner), but it is actually healthy. the book actually helped me understand every relationship i\'ve ever had. i\'ll read the last half of it if/when i find myself in another relationship. the only thing it\'s missing, because of its intended audience i\'m guessing, is how to figure out whether a relationship is worth saving. this book will help couples to communicate better, understand their and their partner\'s motivations and actions much better, but what if that only prolongs the inevitable? i suppose the honesty it would hopefully engender would preclude that, but i did find myself wondering.in any case, very helpful. i wish i could take a crack at editing it, though. be prepared for terms such as "the protest polka" and the like to come atcha. *shudder.* such a shame, considering the worthiness of the ideas inside.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Hands down the best relationship book I have ever read. A paradigm changer--it felt intuitively right from the first chapter, yet I also see the world in a different way. It took the core values I held about life, and showed me how to really live them better. Of course, starting with the relationships closest to me.There are no complicated rules here, what you need to do doesn\'t feel like an overwhelming amount of work, and what Johnson says makes so much sense it\'s not hard to remember. By chapter four you\'ll have a good idea of some things you can do and STOP doing, without even having started the "seven conversations." Johnson\'s methods are based on 25 years of clinical research, and have a 75% success rate. So at least ask yourself this: What have you got to lose? It\'s not a long book, the science is super interesting, and many of the stories are touching.And don\'t be fooled by the frouffy title, it\'s not a frouffy book. ;-) Johnson\'s a scientist, not a writer, so the writing might veer into the self-helpy; or her retelling of the couple\'s conversations sound fake at times (people always "giggle" when I\'m sure in real life they just laughed). But the science she talks about is serious stuff, and the ideas are deep, so I never felt I was being frouffed-over.\n         ', u'\n           \n           I am going to start this review with two contradictory statements: this is an amazing book for laypeople and therapists alike, a total revolution in how we look at romantic partnerships, and very engaging and readable. And I did not finish it. When I added this book to my "to read" shelf, it was primarily with the hope of being able to help counseling clients to understand their romantic attachments, but when I finally picked it up to read, it was in the hopes of improving my own rocky relationship. My partner was feeling smothered and unappreciated, and I was feeling abandoned and insecure. As I read, I came to understand that adult human beings are interdependent and have the same attachment needs we did when we were children. But rather than seeking that primary attachment from our parents, we seek it from our romantic partners. This flies in the face of the common idea that as we become adults, we should grow to not need others, and to be able to attend to our emotions without the help of others. As Fanny Brice says in Funny Girl, "people who need people are the luckiest people in the world." And if we let ourselves admit it, aren\'t we all just people who need people? She then goes on to talk about the types of "demon dialogues" people get stuck in, and how to put an end to them, as well as how to build intimacy (emotional as well as sexual) once the fighting is over. The process is accessible, and the book is intended for people to use in their own relationships, so it\'s an easy read. So why didn\'t I finish it, you ask? Well I got about 4/5 of the way through, and my partner and I decided our life goals are quite different, and that after 8 years, we would be better off as friends. I tried to keep reading, because I actually found the content of the book to be as useful for my clients as for myself... But given the task of grieving a relationship, I just couldn\'t do it. But it\'s good to know that at a less transitional point in time, this amazing book will be there to come back to, rife with wisdom and relatable information.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'18505116', u'Foot-Prints of Vanished Races in the Mississippi Valley', u'138', u'\n4087917\nAlban Jasper Conant\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4087917.Alban_Jasper_Conant\n4.00\n1\n0\n', u'2013', u'6', u'28', u'Book on Demand Ltd.', u'', u'2', u'4.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'28398905', u'The Art of Living in Australia; together with three hundred Australian cookery recipes and accessory kitchen information by Mrs. H.

Its aim is to offer the old in a form that shall meet the needs of young students who are beginning work in debate. The effort has been made only to present the elements of forensic work so freed from technicality that they may be apparent to the student with the greatest possible economy of time and the least possible interpretation by the teacher. <br />It is hoped that the book may serve not only those schools where debating is a part of the regular course, but also those institutions where it is a supplement to the work in English or is encouraged as a "super-curriculum" activity. <br />Although the general obligation to other writers is obvious, there is no specific indebtedness not elsewhere acknowledged, except to Mr. Arthur Edward Phillips, whose vital principle of "Reference to Experience" has, in a modified form, been made the test for evidence. It is my belief that the use of this principle, rather than the logical and technical forms of proof and evidence, will make the training of debate far more applicable in other forms of public speaking. My special thanks are due to Miss Charlotte Van Der Veen and Miss Elizabeth Barns, whose aid has added technical exactness to almost every page. I wish to thank also Miss Bella Hopper for suggestions in preparing the reference list of Appendix I. Most of all, I am indebted to the students whose interest has been a constant stimulus, and whose needs have been to me, as they are to all who teach, the one sure and constant guide. <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br />Windham Press is committed to bringing the lost cultural heritage of ages past into the 21st century through high-quality reproductions of original, classic printed works at affordable prices. <br />This book has been carefully crafted to utilize the original images of antique books rather than error-prone OCR text.

The glorious result was "Gamiani," a classic tale of sensual pleasure and sexual excess.

uninhibited sexual adventure.', u'449', u'3.35', u'176', [(u'to-read', 134)], [u'\n           \n           \u0397 \xab\u0393\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\xbb

That is why I am happy to refer to it here while suggesting you find an edition with more background information.As for the story, it is a tale of extreme and destructive erotic passion with the standard issue references to the depravities to be found in convents and amongst the clergy but it is rather well written.Assuming you do not have serious problems with 'disgust' (this is, after all, only an exercise in the imagination), the bulk of the book is a very erotic read indeed but it is definitely not for faint hearts.Away from its stimulating content (which is likely to interest only a few), it does have some additional interest as a serious literary attempt at following De Sade but in the context of Romanticism.Though not perfect by any means, it succeeds in its aims and provides an insight into a mind-set whose next full literary flowering, after a gap, would be in the Decadent Movement.

It\u2019s also a fictional book about the little-known world of Irish dancing. de Gallai certainly knows a thing or two about this area because his brother was a former member of Riverdance. This novel is ultimately a refreshing one about a strong-willed teenager named Alex and proves that de Gallai is an author that is worth keeping an eye on.This book could have been renamed, \u201cShe\u2019s A Rebel.\u201d Alex is a feisty 15-year-old who is sometimes quick to anger and voice her opinion but she also has a heart of gold. She is forced away from her house and has to live with her aunt, uncle and their family. She has never met these relatives before and at times she has difficulty adjusting to her new home and school life.Alex\u2019s saving grace is her nine year old cousin, Kate. These two girls often speak with a wisdom that is far beyond their years. Sometimes this means they sound precocious and at other points it verges on being unbelievable. An edit and a polish would have helped tighten up these minor flaws with dialogue and structure. Kate is enthusiastic about Irish dancing and is preparing for the state championships. Alex is a former ballet dancer and the two bond over their senses of humour, jibes at one another and a love of the dance.The prose by de Gallai is light, witty and fun and he often mixes this with quite serious themes about families and teenage girls. This book is an engaging little tale about relationships, love and domestic bliss. It\u2019s an amusing book with a strong lead character and shows just how much fun you can have \u201cD.A.N.C.I.N.G in the U.S.A!\u201d***Please note: a free copy of this book was won by the writer through a Goodreads giveaway. \n         ', u'\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           I enjoyed the premise. As an adult Irish dancer who enjoys good YA fiction, the book was right up my alley. However, the ending left me disappointed. Without giving away any spoilers, I will say that I kept waiting for the "things are not what they seem" that the blurb promised. I kept waiting for Alex to discover the "more about her family" that was promised. There was never any mystery; it was a mystery to the reader, but Alex never learned anything new. And some of the conflicts were too easily solved, while the big one, the reason she left home in the first place (which happened in a fairly un-believable way, and continued to be an unrealistic setup for most of the book) is never resolved! The book ends abruptly. And while Alex flirts with the idea of returning to ballet and/or starting Irish dance :the whole time: - she never does!! It seems like the book ends with (hopefully) the intention to continue the story in a second book. I like the characters; Alex and Kate are likable and realistic (although Kate reads about 11, not 9), but the story is just off somehow. Alex\'s take on the Irish dance world is very funny, and I did enjoy following her, but the ending just fell flat.Ugh! I was just so frustrated by it. Who leaves home like that? And why tease us with how good she is at dance if she\'s not going to start it up again? And the bullies were so cookie cutter and had no real motivation.... and why was Bailey such a brat? And again, where is the "truth" about her family that is discovered? All that is discovered is that all along she knew her parents fought and her mother drank, but WE as readers didn\'t know... And the abrupt ending just annoyed me.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This was rather disappointing, if I'm honest. I was so excited to read a book featuring Irish dancing, but the writing style felt weak and a few things strained my credulity somewhat. (Kate does toe stands/walks in her dance but she's in u9 or something. You're not allowed to do those in competition until you're twelve.) I'm also not entirely sure how comprehensible it would've been to someone with absolutely no knowledge of dance. That said, some parts did make me laugh, especially the outsider's impression of Irish dance costumes and competition.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I liked this book and felt that it was well written,although I would of not have the children,teenagers cussing so much.There were a couple of things that I felt left hanging in the book,like what was wrong with Aunt Tammy and also it was a sad ending,but I am guessing that the happy part of the ending was that the family problem was identified?\n         ', u"\n           \n           My first impression of this book was that I didn't like the writing style and I wouldn't be able to finish it. I have to say, though, that the characters and story really began to pull me in. I think de Gallai did a very respectable job of portraying teen angst and personality in a difficult situation. I wish some issues had been better covered-like the nature of Tammy's illness- but overall, found it an interesting read.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'17080672', u'Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations ACT 97 of 1997: Intergovernmental Relations Framework ACT & Related Material 13 of 2005', u'110', u'\n379208\nSouth Africa\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/379208.South_Africa\n3.60\n5\n0\n', u'2011', u'1', u'1', u'Juta & Company', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'35166925', u'Brisbane Insight Pocket Guides', u' ', u'\n902908\nPaul Phelan\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/902908.Paul_Phelan\n3.88\n8\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'11544296', u"Short-Wave Solar Radiation in the Earth's Atmosphere: Calculation, Observation, Interpretation", u'303', u'\n2517547\nIrina N.

It\'s big. It\'s intimidating, but there are such nuggets here that the academic vocabulary - which sometimes really got on my nerves; should I hear the word "diaspora" soon again I\'ll scream - can be overcome.The edition of the book I read is dated but there is actually a new version printed and sold starting in August 2011! I still really recommend David Toop\'s brilliant, brilliant book on hip-hop, called "Rap Attack!".This massively big anthology, however, starts from the start of hip-hop, and delves deeper back in time than that. The elements of hip-hop are of course much more complex than just the verbal, for example the graffiti:By summer 1971 the appearance of the mysterious message \u201cTaki 183\u201d had sufficiently aroused the curiosity of New Yorkers to lead the New York Times to send one of its reporters to determine its meaning. The results of his search, published on July 21, 1971, revealed that Taki was an unemployed seventeen year old with nothing better to do than pass the summer AU. [...] He explained, \u201cI just did it everywhere I went. I still do, though not as much. You don\u2019t do it for girls; they don\u2019t seem to care. You do it for yourself. You don\u2019t go after it to be elected president.\u201d The reporter interviewed other appropriate neighborhood youths, including Julio 204 and Ray A.O. (for \u201call over\u201d), who were following in the footsteps of Taki, to whom they referred as the king, and he spoke with an official of the MTA who stated that more than $300,000 was being spent annually to erase graffiti. Patrolman Floyd Holoway, a vice-president of the Transit Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association questioned by the reporter as to the legal machinery relating to graffiti writing, explained that graffiti was barred only by MTA rules, not by law. Thus writers under the age of sixteen could only be given a lecture, not a summons, even if they were caught in the act of writing on the walls. Adult writers could be charged with malicious mischief and sentenced to up to a year\u2019s imprisonment. Taki confessed that as he grew older, he worried more about facing adult penalties for writing graffiti but admitted, \u201cI could never retire...besides...it doesn\u2019t harm anybody. I work. I pay taxes too. Why do they go after the little guy? Why not the campaign organizations that put stickers all over the subways at election time?"And if you think the Wu-Tang Clan were the first Asiatic influence in hip-hop, you\'re off:Crazy Legs is considered by many to be the main focal point of the transition from old school to new school. Having invented many of the new breakdance moves like backspins and windmills, Crazy Legs is the one to whom many of the new school breakers of today are indebted. But other breakers along the way had their influences on the new school of breaking. Not only breakdancers, but media stars like Bruce Lee and other Kung Fu film stars and martial artists had a major influence on breakdancing culture. As said before, the popularity of Kung Fu films during the mid- and late 70s around the world, and especially in New York City, has had a great impact on breakdancing style. Many of the breakdancers were avid fans of martial artists like Bruce Lee. A large number of martial arts moves were incorporated into breakdancing through the influence of the films and the interest in martial arts vis-\xe0-vis Bruce Lee. The Chinese, like many other folk around the world, mainly the Russian peasants and African slaves in early America, had a dance or style of movement that was influenced heavily by the animals on which they depended for survival. Instead of manifesting itself in dance like in Africa, or through sports like the gymnastics of the Eurasians and eastern Europeans, the Chinese animal emulation was expressed through martial arts. Styles like the white crane, tiger style, five star praying mantis, eagle, and monkey style were means of expressing body movement and fighting techniques through the imitation of animal movement. By imitating animal movement a human was able to do moves and body movements that served as a martial art. Kung Fu, with its imitation of animal movements, is a stylized form of human expression. Its heavy emphasis on style and rhythm was a natural influence and inspiration to breakdancing. The films featuring Bruce Lee and other great Kung Fu martial artists appealed to the working class aesthetics of the Bronx and the rest of New York street kids. Since most Kung Fu movements hug close to the ground and use the whole body, both the hands and feet, it was a natural influence on breaking moves. Windmills, which are gyroscopic body movements, are very similar to certain Kung Fu moves.And then, the music hits. Hard. From a period piece in a national paper, pre-1980s:NEW YORK. A funny thing has been happening at Downstairs Records here. The store, which is the city\u2019s leading disco product retailer, has been getting calls for obscure r&b cutouts such as Dennis Coffy\u2019s \u201cSon of Scorpio,\u201d on Sussex, Jeannie Reynolds\u2019 \u201dFruit Song\u201d on Casablanca, and the Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s \u201cBongo Rock\u201d on Pride. The requests, for the most part, come from young black disco DJs from the Bronx who are buying the records just to play the 30 seconds or so of rhythm breaks that each disk contains. The demand for these records, which the kids call B-beats, has gotten so great that Downstairs has had to hire a young Bronxite, Elroy Meighan, to handle it. According to Meighan the man responsible for this strange phenomenon is a 26-year old mobile DJ who is known in the Bronx as Cool Herc. It seems Herc rose to popularity by playing long sets of assorted rhythm breaks strung together. Other Bronx DJs have picked up the practice and now B-beats are the rage all over the borough, and the practice is spreading rapidly.David Toop has done some extraordinary detective work on where New York rap came from: Rap\u2019s forebears stretch back through disco, street funk, radio djs, Bo Diddley, the be-bop singers, Cab Calloway, Pigmeat Markham, the tap dancers and comics, the Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, Muhammad Ali, a cappella and doo-wop groups, ring games, skip rope rhymes, prison and army songs, toasts, signifying and the dozens, all the way back to the griots of Nigeria and Gambia.11 The mix is very rich. The radio DJs Toop refers to were the jive-talkers of the be-bop era like Daddy O Daylie, Dr. Hep Cat and Douglas Jocko Henderson (the \u201cAce from Space\u201d).As Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash basically created the scene by DJing, introducing MCs and building the scratching techniques that are used to this day. In an interview with Source Magazine, all three are into it:THE SOURCE: Who was the first person to take the record in the bathtub and wipe the labels off?FLASH: That was me. People were getting too close, you know. I will give all due respect to my boys right here, but you know, other people. HERC: He put us on a wild goose chase [everyone laughs].BAM: I had a way of telling things from the color of the album. I could know if it was Mercury or Polygram. Then I would try to see who it sounded like.FLASH: Hey Bam, I followed you on a Saturday with glasses on. I seen one bin you went to, pulled the same shit you pulled, took that shit home\u2014and the break wasn\u2019t on the muthafucka [everyone is hysterical]. BAM: I used to tell people, \u201cDo not follow me and buy what I buy,\u201d and I went into a record store and everyone was waitin\u2019 around to see what I pulled. So I pulled some Hare Krishna records [everyone laughs]. It had beats but . . .FLASH: You couldn\u2019t play that bullshit. I got a crate full of bullshit.After graduating in electronics, Flash began combining his two main interests: sound technology and hard funk. He made his own system and would play at night in local parks. To get the power he needed to operate the system he would run a cable from the decks and amplifier to the nearest street light. Flash became an expert at punch phasing. This is when the DJ hits a particular break on one deck while the record on the other turntable is still playing. The punch works in hip hop like a punctuation mark in a sentence. It helps to give shape to the flow of sounds on the record in the same way that a comma or a full stop helps to shape the flow of written language. And just as punctuation brings time to the pages of this book by telling the reader when to pause, so the punch in hip hop can be used to accentuate the beat and the rhythm for the dancing crowd. Flash was also one of the first hip hop DJs to work with a beat box: a machine that produces an electronic drum beat. Together with his MC crew\u2014headed in those days by Melle Mel\u2014Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five produced a hard rapping style that became their trademark. As Flash leapt from deck to deck using multiple turntables Mel would rap in an aggressive, staccato style to the raw, stripped down electronic beat.This makes me want to go back in time:Afrika Bambaataa likes mixing things up, too. He has been known to cut from salsa to Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony to Yellow Magic Orchestra to calypso through Kraftwerk via video game sound effects and the Munsters television series\u2019 theme tune back to his base in James Brown. And in 1982 he made a record with the Soul Sonic Force called Planet Rock that was a big hit. In its own way, Planet Rock is as bizarre as Adventures on the Wheels of Steel. But the Soul Sonic Force didn\u2019t use the edgy staccato rapping style of the Furious Five. Instead their voices weave in and out of the pulsing party beat with lines like \u201cMore bounce to the ounce\u201d and \u201cPlanet Rock. It just don\u2019t stop it\u2019s gonna drive you nuts!\u201d Meanwhile Bambaataa mixes in snatches of song and sound effects round the steady electronic beat. The rhythm of a rap record by Captain Sky called Super Sporm is crossed with the computer-generated rhythms and melodies of records like Trans-Europe Express and Numbers by the German electro group, Kraftwerk. This is then mixed up with the theme from the Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western For a Few Dollars More. (The Eastwood themes composed by Ennio Morricone had also made a powerful impact on dub producers like Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry in Jamaica in the 1970s.)A large part of the disc jockeys\u2019 mystique and power is their resourcefulness in finding unknown or obscure records that can move a crowd. These can be rarities, white-label pre-releases, acetates, unreleased tapes or simply good songs that slipped through the net at the time they were released. Given the obvious difficulty of identifying tunes in the non-stop collages of the b-boy style, the most creative DJs in the Bronx were able to build up strong local reputations as \u201cmasters of records\u201d\u2014the librarians of arcane and unpredictable sounds that few could match. In time-honoured fashion their secrecy extended to soaking records in the bath to peel off the center labels or giving records new names. Previously jealously guarded lists, emerging gradually at the beginning of 1984, make bizarre reading. Bambaataa was one of the most outrageous: The Bronx wasn\u2019t really into radio music no more. It was an anti-disco movement. Like you had a lot of new wavers and other people coming out and saying, \u201cDisco sucks.\u201d Well, the same thing with hip hop, \u2019cos they was against the disco that was being played on the radio. Everybody wanted the funky style that Kool Herc was playing. Myself, I was always a record collector and when I heard this DJ, I said, \u201cOh, I got records like that.\u201d I started digging in my collection. When I came on the scene after him I built in other types of records and I started getting a name for master of records. I started playing all forms of music. Myself, I used to play the weirdest stuff at a party. Everybody just thought I was crazy. When everybody was going crazy I would throw a commercial on to cool them out \u2014I\u2019d throw on The Pink Panther theme for everybody who thought they was cool like the Pink Panther, and then I would play \u201cHonky Tonk Woman\u201d by The Rolling Stones and just keep that beat going. I\u2019d play something from metal rock records like Grand Funk Railroad. \u201cInside Looking Out\u201d is just the bass and drumming . . . rrrrrmmmmmmm . . . and everybody starts freaking out. I used to like to catch the people who\u2019d say, \u201cI don\u2019t like rock. I don\u2019t like Latin.\u201d I\u2019d throw on Mick Jagger\u2014you\u2019d see the blacks and the Spanish just throwing down, dancing crazy. I\u2019d say, \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t like rock.\u201d They\u2019d say, \u201cGet out of here.\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cWell, you just danced to The Rolling Stones.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d I\u2019d throw on \u201cSergeant Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d\u2014just that drum part. One, two, three, BAM\u2014and they\u2019d be screaming and partying. I\u2019d throw on The Monkees, \u201cMary Mary\u201d\u2014just the beat part where they\u2019d go \u201cMary, Mary, where are you going?\u201d\u2014and they\u2019d start going crazy. I\u2019d say, \u201cYou just danced to The Monkees.\u201d They\u2019d say, \u201cYou liar. I didn\u2019t dance to no Monkees.\u201d I\u2019d like to catch people who categorize records.The daring of Bambaataa\u2019s mixes and the black political input that he has made into hip hop have inspired other artists. Air Force One built a hip hop record round Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous gaffe when he made a \u201cjoke\u201d at a TV station. Reagan had claimed in jest that he had the solution to the Russian \u201cproblem.\u201d \u201cLadies and gentlemen, fellow Americans,\u201d he says, barely able to restrain the laughter, \u201cWe begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d President Reagan was unaware that he was being recorded at the time. See the Light, Feel the Heat begins with Reagan\u2019s \u201cannouncement.\u201d The phrase \u201cWe begin bombing\u201d is picked out and repeated several times as the funk rhythm breaks and crashes in a series of explosions round Reagan\u2019s voice.At the same time, it\'s interesting and a bit sad to see how people were really na\xefve and green in the start of the recorded rap-game, as when most artists start out, I guess:But while he shares these high hopes, a seasoned veteran of \u201cthe business\u201d like Charlie Chase remains acutely aware of the pitfalls and distortions involved. After all, he had witnessed firsthand what was probably the first and biggest scam in rap history, when Big Bad Hank and Sylvia Robinson of Sugar Hill Records used a rhyme by his close friend and fellow Cold Crush brother Grandmaster Cas on \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d and never gave him credit. The story has been told elsewhere, as by Steven Hager in his book, but Charlie\u2019s is a lively version. This is how it happened. Hank was working in a pizzeria in New Jersey, flipping pizza. And he\u2019s playing Cas\u2019 tape, right? Sylvia Robinson walks in, the president of Sugar Hill. She\u2019s listening to this, it\u2019s all new to her. Mind you, there were never any rap records. She says, \u201cHey, man, who\u2019s this?\u201d He says, \u201cI manage this guy. He\u2019s a rapper.\u201d She says, \u201cCan you do this? Would you do this on a record for me?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, sure. No problem.\u201d And she says, \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d So he calls Cas up and says, \u201cCas, can I use your rhymes on a record? Some lady wants to make a record.\u201d You see what happened? Cas didn\u2019t have foresight. He couldn\u2019t see down the road. He never imagined in a million years what was going to come out of that. He didn\u2019t know, so he said, \u201cSure, fine, go ahead.\u201d With no papers, no nothing. And it went double platinum! Double platinum! \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d A single. A double platinum single, which is a hard thing to do.The playfulness of early hip-hop and how it can be at its best in an instrumental sense...Although much is made of rap as a kind of urban streetgeist, early rap had a more basic function: dance music. Bill Stephney, considered by many to be the smartest man in the rap business, recalls the first time he heard hip-hop: The point wasn\u2019t rapping, it was rhythm, DJs cutting records left and right, taking the big drum break from Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks,\u201d mixing it together with \u201cRing My Bell,\u201d then with a Bob James Mardi Gras jazz record and some James Brown. You\u2019d have 2,000 kids in any community center in New York, moving back and forth, back and forth, like some kind of tribal war dance, you might say. It was the rapper\u2019s role to match this intensity rhythmically. No one knew what he was saying. He was just rocking the mike.And no, people didn\'t really like "The Message" that much!Like disco music and jumpsuits, the social commentaries of early rappers like Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel were for the most part transparent attempts to sell records to whites by any means necessary. Songs like \u201cWhite Lines\u201d (with its anti-drug theme) and \u201cThe Message\u201d (about ghetto life) had the desired effect, drawing fulsome praise from white rock critics, raised on the protest ballads of Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs. The reaction on the street was somewhat less favorable. \u201cThe Message\u201d is a case in point. \u201cPeople hated that record,\u201d recalls Russell Simmons, president of Def Jam Records. \u201cI remember the Junebug, a famous DJ of the time, was playing it up at the Fever, and Ronnie DJ put a pistol to his head and said, \u2018Take that record off and break it or I\u2019ll blow your fucking head off.\u2019 The whole club stopped until he broke that record and put it in the garbage.\u201dFunny bit about Sylvia Vanderpool:And rap and reggae have a common root in a record called Love Is Strange by Mickey and Sylvia. This record was released in 1956 at the time when ska and soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll were just beginning. On this record, guitarist Mickey Baker and vocalist Sylvia Vanderpool sing a bantering duet over a lilting Caribbean-flavored shuffle rhythm. In the middle there is a sort of mini-rap between the two. Mickey asks Sylvia how she calls her lover boy. As Mickey keeps asking the question: \u201cAnd if he still doesn\u2019t answer?,\u201d Sylvia calls back to him in a voice that gets sexier and sexier. The record made the top twenty in the States. It was a hit in Jamaica too. It is sometimes classified as a \u201crhythm and blues calypso hit.\u201d And almost a quarter of a century later, it was Sylvia Vanderpool who set up Sugarhill Records with her husband. This was the company that released the first Bronx-style rap by the Sugarhill Gang before going on to record Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.It\'s interesting to see how hip-hop at times could be parasitic onto "itself", e.g. "black culture", while being a magnificent political tool:Although rap would later enhance its technical virtuosity through instrumentation, drum machines, and \u201csampling\u201d existing records \u2014 thus making it creatively symbiotic \u2014 the first stage was benignly parasitic upon existing black music.\n', u'\n           \n           That\u2019s The Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader edited by Murray Forman and Mark Anthony Neal, proves to be an outstanding and informative collection of critical hip hop essays. Forman and Neal do an excellent job of contextualizing each essay as it pertains to certain sections within the book. The anthology is broken up into seven different parts, each focusing on some aspect of hip hop that prompts readers to think critically about hip hop as music and culture. Forman and Neal\u2019s focus on hip hop and hyper masculinity within the anthology illuminates different perspectives on how hyper masculinity fits quite comfortably into the world of hip hop. Adreana Clay\u2019s essay titled \u201cI Used to Be Scared of the Dick: Queer Women of Color and Hip-Hop Masculinity\u201d, gives insight into how hyper masculinity in hip hop lyrics and music videos by male rappers, translates into the community of queer women. If you\u2019re wondering how some queer women express themselves in \u201cthe often sexist homophobic and hyper-masculine genre of hip hop\u201d, Clay\u2019s essay will not only answer the question but challenge one\u2019s view on how \u201cnegative\u201d hyper-masculinity can be in the queer community.\tRaquel Z. Rivera\u2019s article \u201cButta Pecan Mamis\u201d addresses the ways that the issues of language, skin color, and region complicate gender and masculinity discussions for Puerto Rican artists and audiences. Rivera argues that Puerto Rican women \u201cexist as a tropical exotic other in comparison to black women in hip-hop\u201d but also notes that their visibility and idolization as sex symbols is accompanied by profound silence on the part of the women; they act as objects. \u201cButta Pecan Mamis\u201d analyzes the popularization of lighter-skinned (but not white) women as sex objects in rap\u2019s highly visual music-video culture, as well as the ways in which this relates to the masculinity of the black rappers who idolize these women. The article does not, however, address the issue of a Puerto Rican response to this idolization or objectification. Although it does note the lack of Puerto Rican women rappers, it does not note any kind of response by the larger Puerto Rican community or Puerto Rican male rappers. \t\u201cCover Your Eyes as I Describe a Scene so Violent\u201d is a truly enlightening conversation between Michael Dyson and Byron Hurt about the relationship between black masculinity and violence within hip-hop. Dyson begins the conversation as he elucidates the reasons for hip-hops use of imagery depicting so much gun violence within the ghettos. Violence is a cultural form of self-expression, by which stems from the viewpoint of the agents as well as the victims. This self-expression becomes a rough outline highlighting poverty and the oppressive standard of living that always seems out of reach to certain populations of people. Given scraps to fight over, living becomes survival of the fittest and the gun is the upper hand over the competitors. It becomes the link to manhood, the outlet for aggression, the sole means for security, and the symbol for masculinity (359). What makes his explanation so remarkable is his ability to then pull the audience out of this seemingly programmed bias against hip-hop violence and readjust our understanding of how hyper masculinity and violence exist all around us. Hyper masculinity is less of a general representation of hip-hop and more-so a reflection of a broader American trait. Dyson reminds us that it is celebrated and rewarded in everything from video games, sports, Hollywood, politics, and war, but it is only deemed \u201cviolent\u201d in few circumstances such as in hip-hop. He further explains that violent masculinity is \u201cat the heart of American identity\u201d while hip hop is just a product of this environment (360). It is a very intriguing concept that he brings up, calling this phenomenon the social construction of masculinity. He states that everyone is a part of this social construction but no one realizes that their actions are, to a large extent, controlled by these socially constructed ideas of what it means to be masculine; and in effect, their actions also reinforce those working characteristics (364). This idea is particularly evident in the way society accepts violence in the form of hyper masculinity. The sports with the most physical contact often gain the most popularity, while the military is consistently rewarded for aggressive and even ruthless behavior for which is codenamed patriotism. With hip-hop, hyper masculinity increases marketability. For all these occurrences Dyson makes a compelling point that hyper masculinity is not a trait that people are born with, suggesting that this attribute is instead a learned behavior and is shaped by the social and political influences of our society. Finally, Hip-hop has long been a breeding ground for reckless hyper-masculinity, as followers of the culture have, for the most part, regarded artists who maintain an image as \u201chard\u201d as a purer manifestation of the culture. Marc Lamont Hill\u2019s essay \u201cScared Straight: Hip-Hop, Outing, and the Pedagogy of Queerness,\u201d uses this identity of hyper-masculinity in order to discuss the relationship between heterosexuality and homosexuality in hip-hop culture. Hip-hop, like many other popular forms of music, is predicated \u201cupon hyper-masculinity, misogyny and compulsory heterosexuality.\u201d Because of this predication, the outing (rumored or perceived) of a rapper serves as a professional death sentence. The fractured masculinity attributed to a homosexual orientation leads to a decline in legitimacy of the individual within the hip-hop culture. The emergence of the homothug reflects, in Hill\u2019s opinion, a reconciliation with the \u201chypermasculine accouterments of mainstream hip-hop\u201d and sexual identification, which exists because of the overarching racial link to hip-hop culture. While Hill\u2019s argument reflects many pressing issues that continue to dominate mainstream culture, such as the process of outing or the doubting of sexual orientation, Hill does not judge the sources from which much of this discussion stems from. For instance, he uses shock jocks (such as Wendy Williams and DJ Star) as legitimate sources rather than understanding their participation in this discussion exists only to heighten their own publicity. Moreover, artists such as Dr. Dre and Diddy continue to have illustrious careers despite questions of their sexuality. While artists continue to utilize \u201cfaggot\u201d as a negative term, there is some debate over the connotation of the word as directly linked to being gay or rather as a description of weakness. The question remains: is there a difference? Many in the hip-hop community accept homosexuals as individuals, yet continue to use words that degrade homosexual lifestyles. Only until we see the emergence of an openly homosexual rapper, and the reaction of the wider community will we actually be able to reflect on this question.

It will challenge and inform readers of the different aspects of hip hop, as well as provide a good foundation for what hip hop is.

I know, I know. I only took the class because I needed another 2000 level Anthro class and this was all that was available. Not that it was a horrible class, or even a horrible book, it was just...This book was just tedious. It's nearly 800 pages of long tedious essays about the history, politics, and social issues surrounding Hiphop. The information itself is very interesting but I just hated trudging through all these essays. They ALL could have each been about ten pages shorter (or more) and I would have had a better time of it. If you want people to be aware of Hiphop and its issues, I would recommend making it easier to read to a wider audience. Just my opinion.Tedious. That's my word of the day. I read about 15 essays in this book and decided I was done. This class had two other books assigned on top of this one, both of which were much better.Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives: Elements, Embodiment, and Higher EdutainmentandBroken Windows: Graffiti NycAnd hey, the Graffiti one had lots of pictures! \n         ", u"\n           \n           Actually, I haven't read the whole thing but I used this book for a Hip-Hop as political expression class this quarter. As for what I read, some are pretty interesting and decent to understand. Other articles are heavy with critical theory. Did not agree with all viewpoints, but it's always good to listen to different ones. All said, it's pretty good in my opinion and did get me interested on how music can be used for political expression, that I have decided to look for other books in the subject.\n         ", u'\n           \n           2nd ed. is what I have, it is a critical reader which applies many different hermeneutics to the nature of hip hop. Benefits to me have included the global perspectives discussed (esp. Latino and Arabic hip hop movements), as well as a number of discussions of authenticity in light of these global appropriations. This is extrapolated into the development of hip hop, conversations of the n-word, and one of my favorite articles on the diasporic nature of hip hop identity.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'20363983', u'Army Tactical Standard Operating Procedures (Atp 3-90.90)', u'32', u'\n7446035\nU.S. Department of the Army\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1458319369p5/7446035.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1458319369p2/7446035.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7446035.U_S_Department_of_the_Army\n3.89\n280\n23\n', u'2012', u'9', u'28', u'Createspace', u"Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 3-90.90 facilitates development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in order to enhance efficiency and adaptability across the force. ATP 3-90.90 achieves this purpose through linking to a milWiki portal under the milSuite uniform resource locator (URL) containing guidance for tactical SOPs and unclassified examples of SOPs for reference. The SOP portal provides a baseline for developing new SOPs quickly and a forum for improving existing SOPs. The portal presents best practices consistent with doctrinal principles. The Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate established the SOP portal in 2009. The authors attempted to align the original information with pertinent doctrine and regulations. Where the portal's contents differ from current doctrine and regulations, the latter take precedence. The information in the SOP portal is not authoritative doctrine. The examples in the portal do not provide ready-to-use SOPs for Army units. Soldiers developing SOPs for their units are encouraged to apply critical thinking while referring to the models and other resources to aid their own content development. At a minimum, portal users must be familiar with this ATP, Field Manuals (FMs) 5-0 and 6-99.2; Army Regulations (ARs) 25-1, 34-4, and 380-5; and Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA Pam) 25-403. Soldiers are encouraged to use the portal to collaborate, to improve the portal's contents, and to upload new SOP examples. The SOP portal is secure and requires an Army Knowledge Online or Defense Knowledge Online login. The portal's contents are unclassified. Neither this manual nor the SOP portal is intended to regulate the appearance or content of unit SOPs. This ATP uses joint terms where applicable. When formal military terms are identified in the text of this ATP, the terms are italicized and the number of the proponent manual follows the definition. A standard operating procedure is a set of instructions covering those features of operations which lend themselves to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of effectiveness. The procedure is applicable unless ordered otherwise (JP 3-31). A SOP is both standing and standard: it instructs how to perform a prescribed and accepted process established for completing a task. Features of operations that lend themselves to standardization are common and usually detailed processes performed often and requiring minimal variation each time. Well-written and properly used unit tactical SOPs enhance effective execution of tasks; the benefits of SOPs are numerous. They reduce training time, the loss of unwritten information, the commission of errors, the omission of essential steps or processes, and the time required for completion of tasks. This does not mean, however, that carrying out SOPs never requires thought or that SOPs should never change. Indeed, tactical units must change some operating procedures as rapidly as operational environments and missions change. The SOP portal helps units avoid an unnecessary loss of effectiveness that could occur by maintaining unthinking dependence on outdated written procedures. The portal also helps units avoid a loss of effectiveness that could occur when units delay writing down processes that need to become standardized. The doctrine in this manual provides techniques for developing unit tactical SOPs. Units throughout the Army can take advantage of technology to obtain guidance, collaborate in real time, and find information quickly. This manual and the SOP portal are intended to enhance operational adaptability Army-wide. In the short term, the information in the SOP portal will help units establish or improve SOPs more rapidly. In the long term, the intention is that more and more units will build SOPs using the portal and the doctrine in this manual. SOPs throughout the Army should increase in similarity as the combination of doctrinal guidance and Army-wide milWiki collaboration facilitates consensus.", u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'19787186', u'The Calvin And Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book', u' ', u'\n13778\nBill Watterson\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1374016829p5/13778.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1374016829p2/13778.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13778.Bill_Watterson\n4.67\n511384\n6157\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Our heroine, Astiria (aside from having a very Fantasy-esque name) fights the good fight with a mixture of common sense 'real world' strategy (ie: kneeing a goblin in the groin is as effective as kneeing a would-be purse thief) and skills she learned from playing fantasy world games.Lerik is amusing, charming and has just enough conceited male ego to be irritating, but not obnoxious. He definitely wins points in my romance hero book for being able to take a joke without getting huffy. The interactions between himself and his Wood Elf, Oopec (who looks literally like an Elf made out of wood) are funny and filled with affection. Astiria can sometimes be a little too 'everywoman' for my tastes--her complaints are typical (about her physical appearance) and I think she dwells too long on whether or not Lerik would like her if he saw the 'real' her, but overall she was fun and snarky.I would have liked to see more about how...creative Lerik and Astiria could be without breaking a rule placed on them, but I was enjoying the story too much to suffer from that. I'm glad the appearance of the Goblin King was kept to such a minimum.My only real complaint is that the whole thing with Marsoon is kind of contrived by the end of the story. It starts out entertaining (how Astiria ends up in the situation is amusing), but ends up meaning very little since, as one of the characters remarks, leveling up to Level 10 in any RPG is the easiest task. It\u2019s the later levels that give you trouble. I also found it amusing that in the book Astiria tries to finish a novel titled 'The Stone Maiden', an earlier novel by Tina Gerow now out of print.\n         ", u"\n           \n           (2.5 stars) Even as a Kindle freebie this was pretty thin story wise, the idea had real potential - the heroine physically enters a game and her favorite stuffed gargoyle comes to life to take her to the hunky lord who is her destined soul mate and consort - but that potential just wasn't developed. The Fantasy Quest 'game' part of the story skips over the heroine leveling up from level 4 to level 10 and over pretty much all quest part and straight the sex which is her reward for finishing. \n         ", u'\n           \n           Felt like I just stepped out of a time machine. I think I still have several sheets of lined paper with level 42 half-elf fighter and a motley crew of others along with a velvet pouch containing dodecahedrons, octahedrons, etc. and several "manuals".

I literally made me laugh out loud a bit, like seriously? How is it possible that the only person who had common sense was the slave woman? But any who, I enjoyed the read and the plot of the story. Who doesn\u2019t like to read about family troubles? The fact that it was about two brothers fighting over money instead of a woman like your average story made it a fun read. I also loved how the translation made different characters fit in the story but I have to say that the \u201cdumb\u201d thieves were my favorite lol. I have to admire their struggle; they were really trying hard to get back at Ali Baba for what he did but they were just not clever at doing so. But above all I enjoyed the story line and the theme; I would read it over to get a good laugh and kick out of it. \n         ', u'\n           \n           a nice well known Arabian tale.

That's that the gospels should be approached using predominantly literary tools (eg, source and redaction criticism) without equal attention being paid to historical tools. For that reason I found the discussion of post-modernism very superficial, because it did not seem to deal with the issue of whether post-modernism as he described it was a valuable or an appropriate tool for New Testament studies. I was also disappointed by his lack of attention to internal and external historical evidence. I found the tone very inconsistent, sometimes approaching the condenscending. Surely in this day and age this is the wrong tone to take in an overview addressed to 'the beginning student of New Testament literature'. That being said, I found some of his insights interesting and useful. If there is a fourth edition, I suggest losing the historically inadequate 'could the evangelist have been a woman' appendix and beefing up the post-modernism appendix. I think I would always be in disagreement about its applicability but I am sure it can be better explained and defended!\n         ", u'\n           \n           I found "John, the Maverick Gospel" incredibly illuminating. I read it for a lenten church Bible study class. This is an academic book, but as the subject is the Gospel of John, there certainly is a spiritual/faith dimension to its study. In a way, the book is really dense with lots of material - but it\'s not a struggle since the ideas and patterns presented are compelling, and provided new insights relating to my own faith journey.For me, faith certainly is much more than "facts". So looking into the origin and motivation of scripture is not contrary to faith, but enhancing. After all, we are seeking a lens into the lives and struggles of the earliest Christians. That can inform our own lives and struggles in a meaningful way. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the whole discussion of post-modernism near the end less than satisfying. However, the breadth of insights in the rest of the book more than made up for this. I really learned a lot.\n         ', u"\n           \n           i read this along with a bunch of other stuff this spring. it is good. kysar's a good scholar (though any time anyone hazards a statement like this there is bound to be vehement diagreement). But alas I wasn't quite convinced by much of his post modern take. I don't think he followed his own logic through at times. Its been a number of months since I read it so I can give any helpful examples. Its a very good beginner book on John.\n         ", u"\n           \n           An excellent book on a number of levels. While not all of Kysar's claims are convincing, his mastery of the material is excellent.I would recommend his bibliography if only for research purposes. It alone is excellent.Best introduction to John to be read alongside, perhaps, Raymond E.

Now I remember why I don't like to read fiction. It's too tempting for me to argue with the author about how realistic or improbable the events of the story are. I was bored and ready to drop the book for about the first 200 pages. Finally it started to get interesting and I felt committed to see it through to the end. While it was mostly okay, I was dissapointed that a lot of things still were not resolved by the end (it is a series though, so maybe the next book makes up for it). The author's attempts at witty dialogue often seemed out of place with the actual events of the story. The mysterious stranger was a little TOO mysterious. But there was some good action, and an interesting intertwining of characters. So while not exactly my cup of tea, other people (who actually enjoy fiction) may like it. I do however think it would make a good movie- not a great movie- but a good one. I think the events of the story would play out better on screen than they did in print.\n         ", u"\n           \n           I picked this up as an Advance Reader's Copy a few years ago when I still worked at Borders, and I just now finally got around to reading it.

In fact, although the history was interesting, it was a little more in depth than I liked but that's just a personal preference. I found myself having to rewind a few times because my mind started drifting.The characters are interesting. Poor Jamie has had a lot of loss in her life but she has done a good job of moving on and dedicating her life to helping others. As she thought at one point in the book, she is her job. Adara's brother is one of those characters who is larger than life but it fits in this story. Everyone in this book is either good or evil. The main characters are truly good souls and the villains are truly evil.I definitely recommend Chasing Eden especially if you like suspense. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.\n         "], 0]!!!![u'35420136', u'The Birth of Albania: Ethnic Nationalism, the Great Powers of World War I and the Emergence of Albanian Independence', u' ', u'\n4694515\nNicola Guy\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4694515.Nicola_Guy\n4.33\n3\n0\n', u'2018', u'1', u'30', u'I.

She is compassionate, gentle loving soul and I love her spirit.\n         ', u'\n           \n           \u0631\u062d \u0623\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a .. \u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u062e\u062f \u0631\u0627\u062d\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631 :P\u0628\u062f\u064a\u062a \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u062a\u064a ( The Soulmate Secret) \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u060c \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0629 \u0634\u0648 \u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u0648 \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0651\u064a \u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0644\u0651\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0644\u0627\u0642\u064a "\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a"!\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u062a\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0628 \u0646\u0627\u0633 \u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0628\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0630\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0651\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u0651\u064a \u0639\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0631\u0649 their soul mates \u062a\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0635\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 ..\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u062a\u0622\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629\u064b \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0634 \u0628\u0633 \u0625\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0645 \u0628\u062a\u062f\u0648\u0651\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 "\u0634\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0643" \u060c \u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0643\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0651\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0648 \u062d\u0627\u0637\u0637 \u0628\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0627\u062a\u0643 \u0625\u0646\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0628\u0637!

Honestly, I am kinda skeptical towards the exercises she suggests, but her idea is just wonderful. It isn't said that if you do everything that is in the book, you will find your one true love, no. It just makes you be sure that you obviously will find the best partner for you, if you have enough patience. The main idea in the book is that IF YOU WANT TO FIND A PERFECT MAN IN ALL SENSES, WHY NOT BEGIN WITH YOURSELF? Are you sure that YOU are good enough for this charming prince?

T. Rhodes explores the origin and evolution of living things, the changing environments in which they have developed, and the challenges we now face on an increasingly crowded and polluted planet. Rhodes argues that the future well-being of our burgeoning population depends in no small part on our understanding of life's past, its long and slow development, and its intricate interdependencies.The book describes the nature of the search for prehistoric life, the significance of geologic time, the origin of life, the emergence and spread of flora and fauna, the evolution of primates, and the emergence of modern humans.Origins is accessible enough for the layperson but also can be used as an entry-level text for students of evolution, paleontology, and geology.", u'56', u'3.74', u'23', [], [u'\n           \n           This book is excellent at following along the path of natural history and explaining what each era of geological time brings.

I will never look at any landscape, but particularly exposed rocky mountainsides, the same way again.Professor Rhodes simultaneously displays confident authority based on firm knowledge, as well as even-handed scientific skepticism, since he is not promoting e.g. a particular scenario for abiogenesis or a specific solution to the mystery of the K-Pg extinction event. This is a survey, a grand tour, and (for me, not having studied the biological sciences) quite an education.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Mr. Rhodes presents an information packed session on the evolution of life on our planet.

Are you always feeling the strong urge to reply to Emails the moment you set your eyes on them? It may not have occurred to you but you have unfortunately transformed into an Email Junkie, just like most people who have their own Email accounts. As a matter of fact, a typical Email user is said to spend on average 36 times checking their Email an hour. Well, that is an awful lot of time gone to waste and probably a lot of money that could have been generated during that time. <br />Why quit the habit?<br /><br />Because the more time you spend checking for new Emails, the less time you have to do more productive things. Yes, you can blame it on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even online gaming sites that seem to take pleasure in sending updates and notifications to you in your Emails. Just imagine how your inbox would look like after you post a picture on Facebook which generates more than 20 likes. <br />If you are too busy accessing your Emails, managing your Inbox, and Email Writing, how in the world can you ever be on top of your game? You see, by being able to use your time wisely, you will be able to do better work in less time. And this could even spell the difference between getting comfortable and being promoted at work. Think about the opportunity to earn more by being able to maximize your time rather than wasting it scrolling your inbox more often than you blink your eyes. Think too about this time you could have used instead to be with your family and friends rather than spending it in front of your monitor.

Since there were \u201cexams\u201d at the end of each chapter, each section, and at the very end, there was plenty of opportunity for review, and the index was detailed enough to find any material that one needed to examine later.I had a wonderful time working my way through this book and have a firm grasp of its content.

He needs Dortmunder's help in retrieving $700,000 that he'd buried in a small town 30 years before. The problem is that, while he sat in jail, the State of New York flooded the area to build a reservoir; the loot is now under a few feet of dirt and many feet of water. Being a man of great determination but few ethical principles, the thief plans to blow up the dam, emptying the reservoir but also flooding the inhabited countryside to get at his stash.

Meanwhile the thief is losing patience...", u'1628', u'4.14', u'1100', [(u'to-read', 324)], [u'\n           \n           For a series of criminal capers, Westlake\u2019s Dortmunder novels unspool at their own comfortable pace. Readers just sit back and let the whole thing unravel in front of them. The same amusing characters \u2013 Andy Kelp, Stan Murch, et al \u2013 appear again and again, and it\u2019s like being with friends (shady, criminal and sometimes incompetent friends, but friends nevertheless). That\u2019s not to say that these books lack dramatic tension or suspense, as Westlake will happily take his readers to a point of real jeopardy. These are your friends after all, and you do care what happens to your friends.An old and very mean cellmate of Dortmunder\u2019s emerges from prison with the tale of how his greatest ever hoard is now buried beneath the soil and water of a large reservoir. He enlists Dortmunder to help him recover it. If Dortmunder fails, the old cellmate will just blow up the reservoir and drown everybody below.It\u2019s a beautiful scenario of difficult operation versus greed (as well as responsibility to fellow man), and is perfect for Westlake\u2019s laid-back comic set pieces. I\u2019m not spoiling anything by saying that attempt after attempt goes wrong, so that by the end the reader really does empathise with how frazzled Dortmunder is. A particular highlight is the attendance of a low-taste wedding and then \u2013 in my favourite plot strand \u2013 the activities of the gang unwittingly costing the bridegroom his sanity.It\u2019s always tempting to compare these books to the work the same writer did under his Richard Stark non de plume, but they come from different directions. The Parker tales are a deadly cut-throat razor on a cold dawn, while the Dortmunder capers are a nice lie-in followed by a hot breakfast later that very same morning.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Apparently there is a whole series of "Dortmunder" books and this isn\'t the first. It\'s a mildly amusing crime caper novel, in which Dortmunder is the brains (allegedly) for the underwater salvage of a recently released psycho\'s spoils from an armed robbery. It would have been a lot better, though, if not for the computer geek and his computer. The book was published in 1990 and the PC was still pretty new-fangled (the first time I used one was only the year before). The computer geek as comedic butt is not so much the problem (but more on that later) as the enormous length of time spent describing the PC and how it works, what you can do with it (play Donkey Kong, for instance), which nobody needs these days, only to be followed by a bunch of highly unrealistic uses and responses from it. (It\'s as if there\'s a mind in there that can talk back to the user). It\'s dated as well as crass.If you can leave that aside, the rest of it is amusing, particularly the ironic ending, but it\'s hard to do as the PC takes up far to much space in the book and just when you think you\'re permanently done with it, it makes a come-back. I suspect that other Dortmunder novels, with no PC obsessions evident might be better than this one.Back to the computer geek: It\'s a species that\'s going extinct. This is because knowing heaps about computers is not the preserve of socially inept obsessives any more. The younger the generation the more computer knowledge is ubiquitous and unremarkable. Electronic computing pervades life now and the people who have grown up in that environment take it for granted. It is normal and familar. The people who know most about it, far from being social pariahs by assumption are celebrated. So the computer geek as comic butt is a concept that is dating rapidly. Other socially inept geeks are replacing them.\n         ', u"\n           \n           I read this book many years ago at the recommendation of a friend. It was my first Dortmunder novel- and the funniest one yet. I just remember that the characters were all well-drawn, each with their own quirks. It was my introduction to 'Murch's mom', an ace driver, as well as the rest of the unlucky gang. I highly recommend it!\n         ", u"\n           \n           For some reason, it is becoming incredibly hard to find Dortmunder novels in this City. To satisfy my Dortmunder jones, I was forced to borrow this volume, which I had read many years ago, from work. No matter: with Westlake's intricate plotting, and the gang's brilliant malaproprisms and general maladroitness, it was as fresh to me as if I had never read it before. I had even forgotten that herein it is revealed that Murch's Mom, um, rejoices (?) in the name of Gladys.While reading this book, I was suffering through the first week of my Fantasy Baseball League schedule; if ever there was appropriate reading material for managing a Fantasy Baseball team, this is it.

But when she arrives in 1756, she finds her frontiersman doesn\u2019t know her, Nazi soldiers occupy her historic home, and her only friend a mysterious dog who just might be their spy.<br /><br /><br />A Tale He Can\u2019t Believe<br />Ousted from his home by strange Hessian soldiers, fur trapper Zeke Allen can\u2019t believe his luck when his new hunting dog brings him a woman. Knowledgeable in the ways of pioneer life, the lovely Miss LeBeau could make the perfect wife, if not for her crazy tales of time travel, a club called the Saturn Society, and an impossible war in the twentieth century she insists she comes from\u2014and to which she must return.<br /><br /><br />A Predicament They Can\u2019t Escape<br />Slowly, Zeke begins to believe Florie\u2019s crazy stories as his fondness grows into a love she returns.

So, naturally, I had to read it.The word that first comes to mind when thinking back over this book is messy. That\'s how I would describe it. It\'s entertaining in parts, annoying in others, and sends out a confusing mix of messages.\n\u201cI actually need your help. You see, your friends are hot. And you, darling, are the Duff.\u201d\u201cIs that even a word?\u201d\u201cDesignated. Ugly. Fat. Friend,\u201d he clarified. \u201cNo offense, but that would be you.\u201d\nThis above exchange takes place between our narrator - Bianca - and Hamilton\'s resident notorious manwhore, Wesley Rush. Bianca responds to the insult by doing what any self-respecting woman should do and throwing the nearest beverage into the douchebag\'s face. However, being a teenage girl with all the insecurities that go along with that, Bianca can\'t quite forget what Wesley called her.Then she has issues at home. Her mother is away most of the time and her dad is a recovering alcoholic on the brink of a relapse. With all this happening, Bianca longs for a way to "escape". She needs something to take her out of this world, numb her mind and make her forget who she is for a little while... so she sleeps with none other than - you guessed it - Wesley Rush. I get it: the girl has serious issues. No judgement, we\'ve all been there.So here\'s where things get a bit messy. I know this will be especially enjoyable for girls in their teens - just as the author was when she wrote it. I remember the days when I would read this:\n\u201cOn one side, I had Toby. Smart, cute, funny, polite, sensitive, and practical. Toby was perfect in every conceivable way. I mean, he was a little dorky, but that was what made him so adorable. I liked being with him, and he always put me first.\u201d\nand this:\n\u201cOn the other side, there was Wesley. A jerk. An asshole. An arrogant, womanizing rich boy who put sex before everything else. Sure, he was incredibly hot, but he could annoy the hell out of me. He was irritatingly charming, and his cute little grin could really get under my skin. But he had a way of making my heart race and my head spin.\u201d\n...and my heart would race for jerkface too. Then, of course, Bianca had to compare Toby and Wesley to Linton and Heathcliff, which is really just very unfair.I think this is one of those books that was evidently written by a teenager; an extremely talented teenager, I\'ll give her that (I couldn\'t have done it at 18/19) but a teenager nonetheless. Some annoying dialogue aside, the writing itself is decent, but there is something about this story, the relationships in it and the way it portrays feminism which is incredibly immature. When I was in my mid-to-late teens, I had discovered feminism but wasn\'t quite sure what it meant in practice. After writing essays on Margaret Atwood novels, I\'d decided I was a feminist but it took years and my time at college to fully understand it. While I was in high school, I hated double standards and yet was probably guilty of believing in some of them. Stereotypes had been drilled into my brain and I often forgot how stupid they were. I wanted to be a feminist; I wanted to write a great piece of feminist literature; and yet, I still succumbed to my own internalized misogyny. This book feels like it was written by someone with the same issues.First example: Every girl drools over the hot guys except our narrator. I\'m glad that later in the book she learns not to have disdain for them, but it doesn\'t change the fact that these girls are characterized by their constant thrusting of their breasts into the boys\' faces. Second example: Wesley tells Bianca she is a not a slut because she\'s just confused and we all make mistakes. I initially appreciated the way the author portrayed teen sexuality without turning it into a lesson... and then it became a lesson. Why can\'t she just enjoy sex and not be a slut?Third example: \u201cBront\xeb?\u201d I asked, seeing the cover of his book. \u201cWuthering Heights? Isn\u2019t that a little girly, Toby?\u201d\u201cHave you read it?\u201d\u201cWell, no,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve read Jane Eyre, which was definitely full of early feminism. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a problem. Personally, I\u2019m a total feminist, but it\u2019s a little sketchy for a teenage boy.\u201dFeminism is a girls-only club?Fourth example: Bianca ditches her friends as soon as she starts shagging Wesley.I\'m still giving this three stars, though, because it is damn entertaining. The narrator is charming and just enough of a bitch to be likable in that way that makes you smirk knowingly to yourself while reading (we\'ve all had those naughty/vindictive/jealous thoughts too). And when the author is on top girl power form, she comes out with wicked gems like this:\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to be a bitch most of the time. I guarantee I\u2019ll find a reason to yell at you almost every day, and don\u2019t be surprised if a few drinks get dumped on you from time to time. That\u2019s just me, and you\u2019re going to have to deal with it. Because I\u2019m not changing for you or anyone else.\u201d\nAnd the truth is, despite myself, I couldn\'t help being pleased with how this turned out. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr\n', u"\nA note to anyone who chooses to read the following: I am critiquing this book solely based on the first 80 pages or so as I simply didn't have the will to continue any further.There are some spoilers, but only for the first 80 pages.Have you ever been sitting with a group of friends and one of them tells a joke and immediately everyone but you starts laughing? And then you sit there looking like the stupefied idiot who's just not getting it? That's how I felt while reading The DUFF. So many of my GR friends have liked this, and I've read many reviews proclaiming how awesome it is . . . but I just didn't get it. The DUFF has been blurbed by Elizabeth Scott and Simone Elkeles, both of whom are authors that I trust the opinions of. Or rather, did trust.While I'd like to say that The DUFF starts off good but wanes, it doesn't. The DUFF starts off with Bianca sitting in a club, watching her friends dance while she drinks pop at the bar. Not long after, Wesley Rush comes up and starts telling her how he's interested in her friends, and how she's going to help him make them be the next notches on his belt. (That isn't a direct phrase from the book, just to be clear.) And, to add to the insanity, he also so graciously informs her that she is the DUFF: Designated Ugly Fat Friend.And so, naturally, Bianca is disgusted with him for this fact and because he's basically her school's male slut. But what happens next is what really had my head hitting the wall: She decides to use him as a distraction (where have I heard this plot line before? Hmm . . . could it be a dime store romance novel? Why yes, that's it!) and kisses him on the spot.The guy's a brazen asshole who's trying to use you to get into your friends pants\u2014all while telling you that you're a statistically ugly fat chick\u2014and so you decide to make out with him? WTF? No wonder he has no respect for you!Skip ahead a little ways and you'll find Bianca and her friends discussing Wesley's character and kissing capabilities (you know, since Bianca is an expert in that department now): her friends think that he'd be great in bed, but Bianca thinks that any one that sleeps with him is liable to get an STD shortly thereafter.Good observation, Bianca\u2014except\u2014it is only around 30 or so pages later that Bianca sleeps with him herself! WTF?And am I the only one who thinks that the first time Wesley and Bianca are together is maybe even a bit wrongly handled? When Bianca was beginning to think to herself that maybe she doesn't want to have full-blown intercourse with him, and then immediately following that thought she thinks that they are now, in fact, having sex? Again, WTF? I'm not saying that it was rape\u2014since there was no outowards discouragement from her\u2014but, doesn't that seem ridiculous for Bianca to allow him to continue, what with her having those doubts in her head at that very moment? Does she honestly have that little of self-control? self-worth?And as for Wesley, let me just say this: I love arrogance in a guy (I \u2665 Barrons, BTW), but only a certain brand. Wesley's brand of arrogance is obnoxious and deplorable; it's not charming or redeemable in any way to me.I don't know\u2014perhaps trying to read something like this after having just finished a respectable, well-written novel like Emma was a bad idea, but there you have it.Blech.(And, because I don't like to count DNFs towards my challenge, I'll just say Attempted reading on 6/28/11.)\n         ", u'\n           \n           2.5? 3? Over-hyped. \n         ', u'\nWhat a bummer.I decided to read this novel for four distinct reasons:1) The unmistakable hype2) The movie was exactly what I hoped to watch a Friday night3) Many reviewers qualified this book as \u2018\u2018fun\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018absolutely entertaining\u2019\u20194) I wanted to see how the DUFF thing was dealt with in the written story and recognize the changes they made to the cinematographic version (because there always are)But the thing is\u2026 hype lies, this was nothing \u2013 and believe me when I say that \u2013 like the movie, the storyline held so many clich\xe9s it became more boring than entertaining itself and the DUFF thing was scantly explored. It laid there in the background but, really, the author probably only included it to add something \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 to the friends-with-benefits overwritten clich\xe9. I get that there is supposed to be a message behind the DUFF thing, but we only really get it by watching the movie. Aside from the omnipresent stereotypes \u2013 gosh, you could actually swim inside a pool filled with them \u2013 Bianca, the main character, was highly irritating. Obnoxious. Abrasive. Rude. I might seem like a cold-heartened person by saying this, but I truthfully don\u2019t see how Wesley could have \u2018\u2018fallen\u2019\u2019 for her. She was so mean to him, and there was really nothing special about her. Maybe I would have felt differently toward her if she hadn\u2019t bitched about (and to) her friends, her dad and Wesley himself whenever she wasn\u2019t \u2018\u2018in the right mood,\u2019\u2019 which means for half of the story, heh! Ugh. I can\u2019t stand it when people throw at others hurtful words without thinking about the other people\u2019s feelings.Well, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m done with this read. (High fives to self for not having DNF\u2019d.)\n', u'\n           \n           I think one of the worst things that could ever happen to a book is an unsympathetic protagonist. A person would be willing to forgive a lot of things \u2014 loopholes in the plot, slow-moving story, clich\xe9d endings \u2014 if they fell in love with the hero/heroine. Unfortunately, this did not happen to me with The DUFF.I read a blog post by Kody Keplinger today where she remarked that a lot of the people who criticised The DUFF did so because of the sex scenes in the book. Personally, I have no objection to sex scenes in YA books. In some instances, I would even applaud them. It wasn\u2019t the fact that the book portrayed teenagers having sex that bothered me about The DUFF. Even though I come from a very sexually conservative culture, I know the reality, and the reality is, teenagers have sex. Maybe not all, maybe not even a majority, but there is no denying that teenagers do have sex. What bothered me more was the way in which sex was portrayed in this book. And, of course, the fact that for large portions of the story, I was tempted to bitch-slap Bianca. Bianca hates Wesley, the school man-whore who has slept with more women than she can count. He, in turn, insults and hurts her by calling her the DUFF, the designated ugly, fat friend. However, when her parents end up on the road to divorce and everything in her world seems to be falling apart, she finds a way of escaping reality \u2014 sex with Wesley. She gives him a booty call every time she wants to escape the reality of her situation, but slowly she discovers that running away doesn\u2019t really help. In the meantime, of course, she also gets to know Wesley as a person and begins to form a tentative friendship with him. But once she realizes that her feelings for him go deeper than she thought, she breaks things off with him and runs away, yet again.I admire what Kody Keplinger is trying to do with this book. Bianca spends a lot of time struggling with her self-image, with the idea that she is unattractive enough to be labelled a DUFF. There is also no hesitation in portraying teenage sex, with not only Bianca, but most of the other people in this book also being sexually active. There is a feminist undertone to the last parts of the book, where Bianca reaches a realisation that duff, like slut and whore, are just labels that are created to put women down. But I still feel like this book is sort of teetering on the edge of breaking away from regular YA tropes, without ever going the distance. Let\u2019s start with Bianca. To be honest, I really hated Bianca. She is the sort of protagonist who makes me want to throw the book away instead of accompanying her on her journey of growth. Bianca is portrayed as a feminist, but she is also a plain, bitter, sharp-tongued, cynical person who has been rejected by the boy she first fell in love with, an incident that also makes her strongly oppose true love, teenage style. For me, this is actually a very anti-feminist portrayal of a \u2018feminist\u2019. This is traditionally how people who deride feminism portray a feminist \u2013 as a bitter spinster who has given up on men after being disappointed in love. It\u2019s practically a caricature. Despite the fact that Bianca self-deprecatingly calls herself a hypocrite several times in the book, it didn\u2019t endear her to me one bit. There is also the fact that Bianca ditches her friends in favour of getting laid. Yeah, yeah she needs an escape from her problems, da da da, but the fact is, she put the dick before the chicks. And to make things worse, she actually doesn\u2019t seem to understand why her best friend is pissed when she blows her off, refuses to talk to her, hangs up on her and forgets to hang out with her. Instead of feeling guilty and apologetic, she turns around and calls her friend a bitch and a snotty cheerleader. I\u2019m sorry, am I supposed to like this girl and sympathise with her problems?Another sore point for me is the issue of avoidance. Being a very head-on person myself, I tend to get annoyed with people, both real and fictional, who bury their heads in the sand. But sometimes I can understand and sympathise with characters who can\u2019t deal with what\u2019s happening to them, like Francesca, in Saving Francesca. In The DUFF, however, I just didn\u2019t get it. Her father is a recovering alcoholic who has fallen off the wagon, and instead of helping him, she just runs away to have sex, and hopes the problem will go away on its own? She doesn\u2019t even try, right up to the end; it\u2019s her father who finally realises how far he\u2019s gone and makes the decision to seek help. This really got my goat; she\u2019s mouthy and outspoken and opinionated, but she can\u2019t sit down with her father and at least try to help him?And now for the big one, the S E X. I would truly have had no objection to using sex as escapism in this book, if she hadn\u2019t had sex with Wesley. I guess there are people out there who could use sex as a means of forgetting their problems, even if this is not a path I would choose myself. What I really didn\u2019t like was the fact that Bianca re-iterates so many times how much she hates Wesley. She calls him a man-whore and a creep over and over again. She even, at one point, says that his touch makes her skin crawl with disgust. Why, then, would she choose him, of all people to find oblivion with? That not only sounds unhealthy, it sounds like she\u2019s using sex as a punishment. Just once, I\u2019d like to read a book where the sex is not only acknowledged, but is found in a loving, healthy relationship.I also think Keplinger does teenage boys a grave disservice with her portrayal of Wesley. Maybe all those stories of teenage boys having no discrimination when it comes to having sex are true. But I don\u2019t think anybody, boy or girl will, or at least ought to, have sex over and over again with someone who\u2019s not just using them, but actually hates their guts and insults them on a regular basis. Again, a person who settles for something like that should be in therapy, not bouncing around in bed with their nemesis. I mean, Wesley is hot and popular with the girls. He could definitely find a girl who at least likes him a little and sleep with her. And there is no indication in the book, really, that Wesley has any qualms whatsoever about being used and discarded by Bianca. That\u2019s just so wrong.Wesley also gets to do his playboy routine with no obstacles whatsoever because his parents suffer severely from the Disappearing Parent Syndrome (thanks for the phrase, Lucy!). Obviously if he had a responsible caretaker, they would insist that he have a curfew, behave responsibly when it comes to sex and ensure that he lives like a teenager, instead of a Mills & Boon hero. Instead, he conveniently has a grandmother who takes care of his sister, rejects him brutally and doesn\u2019t call Child Services on his parents. Please. The ending of this book was so clich\xe9d, I wanted to barf. Despite being a stone bitch, Bianca somehow manages to make Wesley fall in love with her, gets an easy out from having to decide which of her two suitors to pick (view spoiler)[since the other guy nobly gives her up while admitting that he still has feelings for his ex-girlfriend \u2014 what a cop-out! (hide spoiler)] and worst of all, manages to \u2018reform\u2019 Wesley into a monogamous, loving, romantic boyfriend. And, just to make things worse, Wuthering Heights gets to make an appearance in this pathetic \u2018love\u2019 triangle. For a minute I was like, wait, did I start reading Twilight again by mistake? After Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights has got to be one of the most maligned works of literature in YA fiction. This book had a lot of potential, but it didn\u2019t live up to it. It\u2019s definitely different from the general run of YA literature we read these days, but it got lost somewhere along the way and ended up being a DUFF. \n'], 0]!!!![u'35565311', u'From the Outside: My Journey Through Life and the Game I Love', u'288', u'\n314546\nRay Allen\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/314546.Ray_Allen\n3.86\n22\n3\n', u'2018', u'3', u'27', u'Dey Street Books', u'The record-holding two-time National Basketball Association champion reflects on his work ethic, his on-the-court friendships and rivalries, and what it takes to have a long and successful career in this thoughtful, in-depth memoir<br /><br />Playing in the NBA for 18 years, Ray Allen won championships with the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat and entered the record books as the original king of the three-point shot.

Awesome reading. I couldn\u2019t put it down.First of, what I love about her series is that in every book we not only get a background story on the main characters, but every one of the characters in the past books come back and play a pivotal part of the story. They\u2019re like a family that you want to know what\u2019s going on with them and not be forgotten.I\u2019m not going to give a synopsis, but the story continues after the last one, Midnight\u2019s Seduction. The war continues on and our favorites go back to battle again.The main characters are Ramsey and Tara. We get a glimpse at Ramsey\u2019s revelations in the last book, but we get more detail now in this book. After reading this, I could understand why Ramsey kept this to himself and was cautious. The amount of power he has, is amazing and dangerous.We finally meet Tara here too. Tara comes from a past also full of secrets. Declan wants her badly, even though he knows little about her. She\u2019s not only a Druid, but her family is full of Droughs, who also want her to turn Drough. Tara has some major power and we see that in this book. But what\u2019s amazing is the power and bond of Tara and Ramsey together.Tara\u2019s running from everyone and doesn\u2019t know who to trust. And she\u2019s been running so long that she\u2019s tired. When Tara meets Ramsey, she has no idea who he is, and she doesn\u2019t trust him even though he\u2019s tried to help her. Ramsey has to build that trust so that she can understand that the Warriors can actually help her.So much happens in this book. The battles are amazing and the love story is amazing. It\u2019s fast paced, action packed, has sizzling love scenes, and emotionally packed.Such a great series. I cannot wait for the next one.\n', u"\n           \n           5 Warrior-Druid-worthy stars!Double Deliciousness :DThat was a wonderful installment! Now I'm wondering what will happen next ;)Can't wait to read the next one!\n         ", u'\n           \n           Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi*Beware of spoilers*For the last ten years Tara has lived a life on the run. She once lived with Declan until she overheard him talking about how he was using her and planning to force her to become drough. She snuck out on him and hasn\u2019t quit running since and Declan hasn\u2019t stopped searching for her either as he\u2019s determined that he will reclaim what is his.Ramsey has a new assignment, to protect Tara from Declan. He has started working as a handy man at a Scottish castle where Tara works so he can keep an eye on her. Tara is unaware of Ramsey\u2019s mission as he tries to get close to her so that she\u2019ll trust him enough to go back to MacLeod castle with him.But when Ramsey fails to kill Declan, Tara doesn\u2019t hesitate to go home with an injured Ramsey. They quickly grow close to one another and give in to the attraction they share. But Declan has not given up on recovering Tara and will use any means necessary to retrieve her. It\u2019s obvious to all the residents at MacLeod castle that the only way to stop Declan is to kill him.I really wasn\u2019t sure about a book about Ramsey as he was never a Warrior that held my interest. But I have to admit that I did really enjoy him in this installment. I loved seeing his protectiveness over Tara and the sacrifice that he\u2019s willing to make for her.Tara was a middle of the road character to me. She wasn\u2019t an awesome kick-ass heroine, but she wasn\u2019t a complete wimp either; just somewhere in the middle.I thought this was a nice book even though I figured out the connection with Tara and Ramsey and the strange magical reaction they had to one another pretty early in the novel. Sometimes I do enjoy being proven right after all!I was also surprised that there was no mention of Saffron\u2019s pregnancy, especially during Tara and Ramsey\u2019s \u2018protection\u2019 talk.The big showdown at the end of the book contained a few tragic surprises that I wasn\u2019t expecting, but that is sure to have an effect in the future books of the series. I\u2019m just waiting to see how everything will play out.I\u2019m also anxious for a book on Malcolm. I know the next book isn\u2019t about him, but I\u2019m really hoping one of the other scheduled books will be!http://openbooksociety.com/article/mi...\n', u"\n           \n           Can't believe I'm saying this but the sex was just too much.

This one had more and more and then more. I knew there was something about Ramsey that I loved from all the Highland Warrior and to get to witness it was just, oh my. He found his match in Tara. She has been running for years and now it time for things to come to a stop. She can't run forever. But that has nothing to do with the mysterious handyman that comes to work at the castle. Come on in and enjoy the journey of love, loss, pain, sorrow and connection for Ramsey and Tara. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'29171213', u'The Assurance Magazine, and Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, Volume 7', u'382', u'\n5158478\nAnonymous\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous\n4.15\n1078039\n56497\n', u'2015', u'11', u'15', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Peter David Shapiro has delivered a contemporary successor to the often overly long and boring tales of the likes of John Le Carre to unite two consultants-cum-detectives in an exotic and sophisticated city, Hong Kong, to solve a murder and a money-laundering case, both of which seem to stump and stymie the local constabulary. It\'s a story of a love long ago lost, of two partners united in their professional pursuit yet at odds over the woman, and another love more recently and painfully lost. Shapiro weaves these personal events into the two consultants\' professional lives in realistic and artistic ways, enriching the story with jealousy, doubt, a nice dose or two of sex, and a lot of twists of the tale.I like a novel with believable characters and a unique plot. I\'m pretty tired of the same-old same-old commonly found in mystery, espionage, spy and thriller novels. Shapiro demonstrates, through his writing skill, an understanding of the genre, most especially by incorporating contemporary Asian business-and-politics theme into the Shanghai and Hong Kong setting. He describes Hong Kong so well you can almost see it, and wish you really were seeing this glittering, elegant, multicultural city that twinkles twice in the reflected light across its harbor. His perspective is so current, in fact, that I just read a remark in the New York Times about how Mao might have changed a lot of stuff, but he didn\'t change the basic greedy nature of the human animal. Shapiro demonstrates just how true that is in "The Trail of Money." We follow the trail along with his two main characters, casting our gaze upon one character after another, each of whom is capable of being the suspect, yet experiencing an "Aha!" moment when we finally see who it really is. One of my favorite recent quotes is, "It\'s not the mystery that entertains you, it\'s the things that happen along the way." I think a lot of mystery-writers need to pay attention to that. Peter David Shapiro does a good job of it.\n', u"\nThe Trail of Money is a thrilling ride, from cover to cover. Harry West just can't catch a break. Still reeling with grief over the loss of his daughter and his crumbling marriage, he throws himself into his work. He goes to China to evaluate a business deal with the son of one of the richest men in Asia. However, that's not how it all goes down. Nothing is ever simple. Unbeknownst to Harry at the time, Edward Woo has connections to the Chinese Mob and is deeply involved in money laundering. He has plans to take over his father's company and Harry finds himself barely treading water as he investigates. The world-building is unique and complex, filled with wonderful, fully developed characters that have their own agendas. Harry is a very likable protagonist and Shapiro paints a vivid and detailed past and present that sets up a precarious future for Harry, unless he can overcome some personal issues. But it's the adventure in finding the truth that overlaps everything and kept this reader riveted from cover to cover. I highly enjoyed it!\n         ", u"\n           \n           Shapiro takes us to the streets of Hong Kong, where Boston-based consultant Harry West gets wrapped up in corruption on both business and government levels. The plot is intricate, set in a world where everyone has something to hide. We learn the facts along with Harry, and the unknown keeps us slightly off balance along with him. Harry is a complex character. He's slightly damaged from a tragic past. He has strong feelings for a woman he can't have, and is finally opening up to the possibilities of a future with someone new. His past and future collide in the midst of his struggle to get his job done before time runs out.This is a fascinating, plot-driven story. The only reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 is because, at times, details were rehashed between multiple characters through various scenes, and this slowed the pace down considerably for me.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I realised that The Trail of Money had been on my reading list quite a while and decided to start it. If I am being 100% honest the cover didn\u2019t quite do it for me (and I think covers can make a huge difference with people just picking the book up in the first place), however I didn\u2019t let me put that off. Early on we meet Harry West who is travelling to Hong Kong. He is a consultant who has been employed by the Government to check out a huge business deal that has been proposed.The first few chapters were hard going and there was quite a lot of information to take in about the deal itself. I found my attention wandering and wondering whether I had made a good choice in reading this book. His colleague is based in Hong Kong and before long it becomes apparent that Harry has known his colleagues fianc\xe9 for some time. There is also the female reporter Erin who Harry met on the plane on the journey over who is reporting on the same people involved in the business deal.It took me at least a quarter of the book before I finally got into it, and I\u2019m glad I persevered because that\u2019s when it got really interesting. Although it\u2019s what I would call a slow burner, all the information you receive at the beginning starts to become clearer as the book continues. Harry is unwittingly drawn into the corrupt dealings of Hong Kong. I read the second half of the book a lot quicker than the first and when I finally got to the end felt like I had discovered a pretty good book. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is not the sort of book I would normally choose to go for, but at the end I felt it was totally worth it. This felt more like a mystery than a crime and was quite a complex book, but I think once you get past the first quarter you become absorbed into wondering who plays what part of what is going on.Overall, I would certainly pick up another Shapiro book but would hope that in the future his covers are a little more enticing as sometimes it\u2019s what makes the difference between picking up a book or walking right past it. Maybe not my usual type but still enjoyed it nonetheless. \n', u'\n           \n           Meh...\n         '], 0]!!!![u'25049357', u'Identidad cultural caribe\xf1a y otros ensayos antropol\xf3gicos', u' ', u'\n7226292\nCarlos Hernandez Soto\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377616645p5/7226292.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377616645p2/7226292.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7226292.Carlos_Hernandez_Soto\n4.75\n4\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'El libro Identidad cultural caribe\xf1a y otros ensayos antropol\xf3gicos contiene ocho ensayos de corte antropol\xf3gico.<br />El primero, Identidad cultural caribe\xf1a, discute los conceptos de identidad cultural y "regi\xf3n del Caribe" para luego centrarse en el enlace de estos conceptos con el de "identidad caribe\xf1a". Se concluye afirmando que la identidad de los individuos y grupos que habitan esta regi\xf3n no es est\xe1tica sino din\xe1mica y es, por consiguiente, cambiante debido a estrategias identitarias utilizadas de acuerdo a la diversidad de las situaciones hist\xf3ricas.<br />En La semi\xf3tica de la cultura se establece la relaci\xf3n entre semi\xf3tica y cultura, se examina la necesidad o conveniencia del estudio de la cultura desde la perspectiva semi\xf3tica y se expone brevemente el m\xe9todo de an\xe1lisis semi\xf3tico-estructural e interpretativo propuesto por semi\xf3logos y antrop\xf3logos de la semi\xf3tica de la cultura. <br />El ensayo sobre Diversidad cultural e investigaci\xf3n en Rep\xfablica Dominicana presenta un recuento de los esfuerzos realizados para identificar el patrimonio cultural inmaterial de la Rep\xfablica Dominicana, cuyo conjunto revela la diversidad de las expresiones culturales de este pa\xeds caribe\xf1o. Se se\xf1alan algunos problemas de investigaci\xf3n relativos a la diversidad cultural que ameritan ser estudiados y se identifican las instituciones que est\xe1n llamadas a realizar esos estudios. <br />En Mito ta\xedno y literatura dominicana, se establece que lo importante del relato m\xedtico no es la explicaci\xf3n concreta sino la actitud filos\xf3fica de admirar el mundo e intentar dar una explicaci\xf3n del mismo. Los mitos ta\xednos, a los que se refiere el ensayo, revelan la teogon\xeda, la cosmog\xe9nesis y la antropog\xe9nesis de grupos arawacos que se asentaron en La Espa\xf1ola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico y el Oriente de Cuba. Este ensayo trata sobre la repercusi\xf3n de estos mitos en la literatura dominicana. <br />El An\xe1lisis antropol\xf3gico de la Novela \'Over\', de Ram\xf3n Marrero Aristy, se centra en la situaci\xf3n de neoesclavitud de los obreros de la industria azucarera, as\xed como en la estructura familiar y relaciones de parentesco de estos obreros, sus entretenimientos habituales, sus caracter\xedsticas ling\xfc\xedsticas y el racismo imperante en el ambiente social.<br />En el ensayo Aportes antropol\xf3gicos de A\xedda Cartagena Portalat\xedn se ofrece una visi\xf3n cr\xedtica de las investigaciones antropol\xf3gicas de una mujer que se siente mulata y negra y desde ese sentimiento realiza un estudio exploratorio sobre los remanentes negros en el culto del Esp\xedritu Santo de Villa Mella. Y no obstante su desmesurado amor por la negritud, esa mujer, que es tambi\xe9n egregia poeta, d\xe1ndose cuenta de que no puede echar por la borda el pasado aborigen de su patria, Rep\xfablica Dominicana, emprende un equilibrado estudio sobre la danza, la m\xfasica y los instrumentos musicales de los abor\xedgenes de Quisqueya. El ensayo da cuenta de los aportes de Cartagena Portalatin a los estudios antropol\xf3gicos emprendidos en el pa\xeds. <br />Los estudios afrodominicanos es un ensayo que da una visi\xf3n panor\xe1mica de las investigaciones referentes a la influencia africana en la historia y cultura dominicanas a partir de los a\xf1os 1969 y 1973. En el primero de \xe9stos, Franklin Franco publica su obra sobre Los negros, los mulatos y la naci\xf3n dominicana y en el segundo se celebra el Primer Coloquio sobre la Presencia de \xc1frica en las Antillas. Los grandes aspectos contemplados en este ensayo son: el hist\xf3rico, el de la religiosidad popular, el de los inmigrantes afroamericanos, el de los inmigrantes haitianos y otros aspectos referentes a cuestiones de raza, lengua y g\xe9nero. El ensayo concluye con algunas propuestas. <br />El \xfaltimo ensayo del libro es El \'banko\', gran fiesta ritual de vivos y difuntos. En el \xe1rea geogr\xe1fico-cultural de Villa Mella, en la Rep\xfablica Dominicana, el banko es una gran fiesta ritual de regocijo y comuni\xf3n entre los miembros vivos y difuntos pertenecientes a un mismo \'fundo\' familiar. Con su celebraci\xf3n, se dan por terminadas las obligaciones de luto, reintegr\xe1ndose los parientes sobrevivientes a la vida social normal, en tanto que el difunto alcanza su reposo en compa\xf1\xeda de sus antepasados, haci\xe9ndose realidad el pasaje de la muerte a la vida.

"The Black Hunter" is filled with adventure and romance, and is set in Quebec in the 1750\'s. James Oliver \'Jim\' Curwood was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. He was born on 12th June, 1878, in Owosso, Michigan, USA. In 1900, Curwood sold his first story while working for the Detroit News-Tribune, and after this, his career in writing was made. By 1909 he had saved enough money to travel to the Canadian northwest, a trip that provided the inspiration for his wilderness adventure stories. The success of his novels afforded him the opportunity to return to the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year - allowing Curwood to write more than thirty such books. Curwood\'s adventure writing followed in the tradition of Jack London. Like London, Curwood set many of his works in the wilds of the Great Northwest and often used animals as lead characters (Kazan, Baree; Son of Kazan, The Grizzly King and Nomads of the North). Many of Curwood\'s adventure novels also feature romance as primary or secondary plot consideration. This approach gave his work broad commercial appeal and helped drive his appearance on several best-seller lists in the early 1920s. His most successful work was his 1920 novel, The River\'s End. The book sold more than 100,000 copies and was the fourth best-selling title of the year in the United States, according to Publisher\'s Weekly. He contributed to various literary and popular magazines throughout his career, and his bibliography includes more than 200 such articles, short stories and serializations. Curwood was an avid hunter in his youth; however, as he grew older, he became an advocate of environmentalism and was appointed to the \'Michigan Conservation Commission\' in 1926. The change in his attitude toward wildlife can be best expressed by a quote he gave in The Grizzly King: that \'The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live.\' Despite this change in attitude, Curwood did not have an ultimately fruitful relationship with nature. In 1927, while on a fishing trip in Florida, Curwood was bitten on the thigh by what was believed to have been a spider and he had an immediate allergic reaction. Health problems related to the bite escalated over the next few months as an infection set in. He died soon after in his nearby home on Williams Street, on 13th August 1927.

The prevailing attitude has always been here that the French were a nuisance that had to be gotten rid of. Many here have seen the movie Last of the Mohicans, and may have even read the book. That book was from the English perspective. I for one have always thought the English were primarily the aggressors and I\'ve always felt sorry for the French during that war . It was nice to read a fictional book from that time period that actually was written from the viewpoint of the French. I like to think of this book as a sort of French answer to The Last of the Mohicans. I learned a lot about the French perspective during this war and came to sympathize even more with their situation.It took me a while to really get into this book. It starts out really slow and takes a while to really hit it\'s stride. I thought the end of the book was fantastic though. Quite an exciting climax. In particular I found the protagonist David Rock\'s experiences participating in the failed Braddock Expedition against Fort Duquesne to be utterly fascinating.The book ends on a happy note, with David & his love Anne reunited and living safely and at peace on the St. Denis manor in the Richelieu River Valley after an Indian attack had been successfully repulsed. I felt that ending was a bit ironic though, because they were far from safe. Another Indian attack could happen at any time. What\'s more, within four years British General Amherst would invade and conquer the region with a massive army. None of that was foreshadowed or alluded to at the end of the book. Strange.I\'m eager to read more books & novels from this time period. It definitely was a very fascinating time in history, even though my French lost the war. The author James Oliver Curwood said in the prologue, referring to the French & Indian War, "Probably no period in the history of the North American continent offers to the writer of romance a field richer in incident or one more filled with the picturesque and thrilling life of the pioneer than that with which this novel opens." I heartily agree.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Subtitled "A Story of Old Quebec" this shows the beginnings of the French & Indian War from the French colonists perspective. I have a fondness for Curwood\'s books set in the Great North Woods but this was not one of his best. A little pedantic and slow at first but ultimately informative and interesting. Big stress on nobility, honor and stoicism in the face of hardship. The more recent F&I novel,Shadowbrook by Swirling showed many similarities to the basic story here.\n         ', u"\n           \n           A bit slow getting started, and I tend to dislike heavy-handed foreshadowing. But the story unexpectedly got past most of that about halfway through. So definitely a good read, and a fascinating setting that's pretty much forgotten these days.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I absolutely love this book, have two copies.

We know about Oskar Schindler and I most recently learned about Irena Sendler. This is an admirable attempt to capture a story that I knew nothing about - the German circus and how some Jews were hidden as circus performers. I found it interesting because I didn't know about it and uplifting to know there were good people willing to take risks to save their fellow man. Noa, a 16 year old Dutch girl, makes a mistake, sleeps with a German soldier and loses her family, her baby and the life she knew . An act of courage saving a Jewish baby from a carload of babies on a train, will endear her to you. Astrid, a German Jew from a circus family, falls in love and marries a German soldier, and the outcome is not a good one when she is forced to return home to find her family gone . Enter the German circus owner Herr Neuhoff who will do what he can to save these Astrid, Noa and the baby that she rescued.I'm not sure why but I had a hard time feeling any connection to the characters and even their connections, relationships and friendships didn't grab me . While it is an important story, it just didn't come together for me with a lot of focus on the romantic relationships. There are so many good reviews for this, so maybe I missed something but stacked up against the Holocaust literature that I have read, this one garners 3 stars for the effort to tell a story based on facts that inspired the author.  I received an advanced copy of this from Mira/Harlequin through NetGalley.\n         ", u'\n           \n            !! NOW AVAILABLE !!At the age of 16, Noa is forced to leave the home of her parents, her family, when they notice her belly swelling with child. Unmarried, impregnated by a German soldier, she struggles to find a way to survive. She finds a cleaning job at a train station, which will become a path that changes everything for her. In her haste to leave this town, which has suddenly become unsafe for her, she runs away into the darkness one night. As she continues to trudge on through the snow, the cold has reached through her skins to her bones, and the snow continues to fall. She needs to find a place to hide, to rest, but there is none to be found. Still, she keeps going, forcing herself to step once more, and once more again until her body refuses and she and the infant she\u2019s carrying fall into the snow. Found by one of the performers of a traveling circus, Noa and child have been safely carried back to the base location of the circus, but staying safely with the circus can only be an option if Noa performs as an aerialist, an option to which Astrid is opposed since she will have to train her. Astrid grew up in the circus, was flying on the trapeze as long as she can remember. She knows that to train this girl will require more time than they have, and she immediately resents Noa. For those that loved The Nightingale and / or Water for Elephants, this is being praised as a blend of the two stories. There are elements of both in this, with Jenoff weaving an emotional, memorable tale of these lives. When our families have rejected us, or we\u2019ve rejected them, or they\u2019re gone, what substitutes for that connection? Even when we fall in love, join lives together or marry, we are creating our own families, extensions of the ones we were raised in. But in this time, this place, trust isn\u2019t so easy to come by. With Hitler\u2019s Germany everywhere, those whom you trust become your family. Eventually the circus becomes Noa\u2019s family. Eventually she can\u2019t imagine a life without them. Heartbreaking, yet sweetly memorable. Pub Date: 21 Feb 2017Many thanks for the ARC provided by Harlequin / MIRA, Edelweiss and author Pam Jenoff\n         ', u"\n           \n           THE ORPHAN\u2019S TALE by PAM JENOFF is an emotional, heartwarming, and heartbreaking Historical Fiction novel bringing together a tale about a traveling circus in Europe during World War II and of the friendship and sorrow of two women aerialist performers from the circus. I found the circus theme to be quite enlightening, fascinating, and interesting as I haven't read too many books about traveling circuses during this time period. We also learn through The Author\u2019s Note that this story was inspired by real people that the author met during her research for this novel and that the circus was a way to hide some Jewish people to help keep them safe during the Holocaust, although it was not a biography it was purely fiction.PAM JENOFF delivers an intriguing, fascinating, and beautifully written tale here told in dual points of view of our two main characters, Astrid and Noa. This is a tale about friendship, family, survival, bravery, secrets, and the sacrifices that these two characters faced during their time performing at the circus. Through their stories we see their friendship strengthen which ultimately bonds these two women together. After finishing a novel like this and reading The Author\u2019s Note it always seems to make the book so much better for me as I really like knowing that the book was inspired by real people and events. Would recommend!!Thank you so much to NetGalley, Pam Jenoff, and Harlequin for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this book for a fair and honest review.All of Brenda & my reviews can be found on our Sister Blog:http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi...\n", u'\n           \n           I\u2019m somewhere between 3.5 \u2013 4 stars on this book.I enjoyed this WWII story told through the unique perspective of the traveling circus. I read a lot of Holocaust novels and it always amazes me when I discover a completely different wartime perspective where brave men and women risked their lives to do the \u2018right thing\u2019 by hiding Jews knowing it would end with prison, torture or death for themselves if they were caught. It always makes me question myself \u2013 would I have been that brave during that time? I can only hope I would have had even a small amount of the bravery of these unsung heroes. I was shocked to learn that the circus sheltered Jews during the Holocaust - circus owners and performers took major risks hiding Jews within their acts and in the backstage staff, knowing they could be searched and found out at any random checkpoint along their travels.This book started off really strong for me and was a 5 star read until I got about 2/3 of the way through. I had a hard time fully connecting with the characters after that point. I liked the characters and enjoyed their story, but couldn\u2019t quite get to the point of being completely engrossed in their lives and decisions in the latter half of the book. The believability of Noa and Luc\u2019s romance wasn\u2019t there for me. It seemed too fast and convenient. I liked both of their characters, but the writing didn\u2019t fully pull me into their love story. Regardless of this, I still thoroughly enjoyed learning about the traveling circus during the war. I cried while reading the Author\u2019s Note where she explains the background to her storyline. The fact that the boxcar full of babies, \u201cUnknown Children\u201d, described in the novel is based on a true story is heartbreakingly hard to accept. It is clear that the author, Pam Jenoff, has done an incredible amount of research to create this novel - she weaves fact into this fictional story so seamlessly. Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it, although I enjoyed the author\u2019s novel \u201cThe Kommandant\u2019s Girl\u201d much more. \n         ', u'\n           \n           Noa is a sixteen year old Dutch girl who cleans a German rail station in exchange for food and shelter. She is alone and destitute after being after being disowned by her family. Noa became pregnant by a Nazi soldier during the occupation. She was forced to give up the child for adoption and her parents could not forgive her transgressions. One evening she hears noises coming from a railway car in the station. She finds it filled with Jewish infants, some dead and some clinging to life. Still grieving and in shock from her own loss, she makes an impulsive decision to rescue one baby. Noa finds refuge with a traveling German circus troupe. She trains to be an aerialist under the supervision of the lead performer, Astrid. Astrid\u2019s family ran a circus prior to the war and she is hiding her Jewish roots. Both women have a difficult time connecting while they guard their precious secrets. Over time their rivalry begins to breakdown and a bond develops. This book is narrated in the voices of the two main characters. This is an emotional tale of survival and courage during a difficult time in Europe. Although it is not a biography, this story is loosely based on real people and events researched by the author.Giveaway until 3/12 on my blog https://www.facebook.com/suzyapproved...\n'], 0]!!!![u'33003644', u'A Soldier&apos;s Heart', u'378', u'\n19012\nEileen Dreyer\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1337978330p5/19012.jpg\n\n\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1337978330p2/19012.jpg\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19012.Eileen_Dreyer\n3.66\n12688\n1311\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u"Twenty years ago in an EVAC hospital in Vietnam, Claire Henderson saved Tony Riordan's life.

It is about PTSD(post-traumatic stress disorder).Tony Riordin served in the Vietnam war and he was one of the lucky one's he survived and came back and had a daughter Gina. He still has nightmares but with the help of his family he has tackled them. He is now ready to face the past which he tried to ignore and wants to thank the nurse that saved him, Claire. He tracks her down and sees in her eyes that she has not laid the ghosts to rest.Claire is a part-time nurse and is trying to run an inn along with her daughter and son. Her son wants to be a fighter pilot and Claire can't deal with that. She has issues, she never talks about the war because it never did her husband any good(who killed himself), and she never had a supportive family to come back to. So, she plays down what she did, she was only a nurse but things are getting worse for her and Tony coming back triggers it even more. Her kids know that something is wrong but don't voice it, since the war is a part of her past she doesn't even acknowledge to herself.If you are expecting a hot and heavy romance this is not it. The book is slow, we see family moments, Claire trying to drown her problems by throwing herself into children and still failing. You don't expect a woman who has hidden her problems for two decades to suddenly accept them. It takes a lot of time and Tony is patient. Even when they fall for each other Claire is afraid.I will categorize this book into one which tried something really different. You don't have to kill in order to be affected, war has consequences, a medal is no reflection of human pain and suffering.\n         ", u'\n           \n           I read this for the first time 20 years after the original publication date and it\'s pretty amazing how well it holds up and how revolutionary it still feels in a lot of ways. Older couple (in their 40s - huzzah!) and a military vet heroine who suffers from PTSD is not something you see every day in the genre, even today - even with more women serving in the military than ever before. The romance sometimes get a little lost under the weight of the emotional baggage, and while that normally would detract for me, I\'m more forgiving with this story because the Vietnam "stuff" is so very good. I loved any scene that showed the heroine "being a nurse," when the characters talked about their experience in the war, and how the author framed it around the current events back in 1994 - namely US troop involvement in Somalia. A textbook example of a book I\'d point any detractor of the genre too. Really well done.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This book caught my attention when I saw the Dear Author Classic Review because it's not often you see a book with a female protagonist with PTSD from war. It was originally published in 1995, so may be one of the first, if not the actual first romance novels to tackle PTSD in women. This book is available to check out from OpenLibrary https://openlibrary.org/books/OL35664... . As always with OpenLibrary, use Adobe Digital Editions to download the PDF version because it is a scanned copy of a physical book.Tony Riorden gets the boulder moving when after 20 years, he finally seeks out Claire, the nurse who saved his life during Vietnam. Of course, that boulder was already tipping from the stress of her job as a supervisory nurse, trying to open her own bed and breakfast, and the fact that she has a 17-year-old son who is wild to join the military to become a fighter pilot all happening during the UN intervention in Somalia.When Tony sees that he's caused harm by his visit, he decides to stick around to see if he can help. So of course, they fall in love.The romance part of this book is fairly light because most of the emphasis, and rightly so, is on how Claire is handling or in some of the cases, not handling, her life. The intimate scenes are pretty meager as well and for all of the interest they added, should have just been completely fade to blacks.What worked for this book for me were the cast of secondary characters and the experience of PTSD that rang true based on what I know of the people in my life. What also worked for me was the way Tony tried to help without being a macho overbearing alpha male and then when Claire finally did decide she needed help he gave her the information she was seeking and then stepped back to allow her to heal on her own. Naturally, this made him a bit of a Mary Sue; you can't win for losing with me.Solid 4 stars for the story and the mustache ;)Cross Posted http://erinsburnsbookshelf.blogspot.c...\n", u'\n           \n           I enjoyed reading this book about the aftermath of Vietnam War.

Part of this is because of the fact that prison is the ultimate "melting pot." In the free world people tend to intermingle with people that are already within their own groups. In prison there is no such luxury - inmates from all socioeconomic classes, ethnic groups, nationalities, religions, educational levels, sexual orientations, and just about any other dividing quality you can think of, are forced to live, work, eat, sleep, and otherwise interact together. In order to communicate effectively, and in a way that prevents most of the guards from knowing what is going on, prison slang or lingo has evolved. While much of it is common in many or most prisons and regions, there is also a good portion of it which will be unique to certain geographic regions, levels of incarceration, or just plain local variances. Who should read this book Inmates who are new to the system, or about to go in. Not just because of the fact that they will have a quicker and easier time adapting, but also because reading the phrases and what they mean gives insight into how the prison language, and thus inmate mindset(s), operate. There is a certain amount of "matter-of-factness" to the slang, along with a fair amount of dark humor. Both of those qualities help remind the participants to stay sane in a situation that is inherently maddening. Inmates who have been in the system for a while. There is a fair amount of humor in the phrases included in this book, and for an inmate to be able to sit and read about his or her genuine experiences and culture, well, it gives them the ability to smile a little bit. It reminds them that they are part of a larger human experience. Families of inmates. Family members who communicate with loved ones in prison will often find phrasing that they don\'t fully understand in letters, phone calls, and direct communication during visitation. Oftentimes they won\'t understand the phrasing and will be hesitant to ask what it means. As a result, communication between the incarcerated person and their caring family members can falter. This book will hopefully help families not only understand the phrases that their incarcerated loved ones pick up, but will give insight into the mindset inside. It can be dark, but there is a humor to almost all of it. I mean, come on-how can you not appreciate calling the death penalty a "stainless steel ride"? It is bitter wit-it is acknowledging the darkness of death while joking about it. It is culture created to tell the staff they can go fuck themselves-the inmates retain control of their language and to a large extent the rules they choose to follow, and the rules they choose to break. Anyone interested in prison culture. Frankly it always amazes me that anyone would be interested in prison culture. I suppose it\'s a little bit like studying the damned souls in Dante\'s Inferno, and gives one a sense of... I don\'t know precisely what.

Putnam's Sons", u'In the new novel featuring war veteran Peter Ash, an action hero of the likes of Jack Reacher or Jason Bourne (<i>Lincoln Journal-Star</i>), Ash has a woman\'s life in his hands and her mystery is stranger than he could ever imagine.<br /><br />War veteran Peter Ash sought peace and quiet among the towering redwoods of northern California, but the trip isn\'t quite the balm he\'d hoped for. The dense forest and close fog cause his claustrophobia to buzz and spark, and then he stumbles upon a grizzly, long thought to have vanished from this part of the country. In a fight of man against bear, Peter doesn\'t favor his odds, so he makes a strategic retreat up a nearby sapling. <br /><br />There, he finds something strange: a climbing rope, affixed to a distant branch above. It leads to another, and another, up through the giant tree canopy, and ending at a hanging platform. On the platform is a woman on the run. From below them come the sounds of men and gunshots. <br /><br />Just days ago, investigative journalist June Cassidy escaped a kidnapping by the men who are still on her trail. She suspects they re after something belonging to her mother, a prominent software designer who recently died in an accident. June needs time to figure out what is going on and help from someone with Peter\'s particular set of skills. <br /><br />Only one step ahead of their pursuers, Peter and June must race to unravel this peculiar mystery. What they find leads them to an eccentric recluse, a shadowy pseudo-military organization, and an extraordinary tool that may change the modern world forever.<br /><br />"Lots of characters get compared to my own Jack Reacher but Petrie\'s Peter Ash is the real deal." ~ Lee Child', u'3076', u'4.06', u'1206', [(u'to-read', 618), (u'currently-reading', 130)], [u'\n           \n           Hell, yes! Once again, Nick Petrie proves he knows how to write a thriller that kicks ass and takes names.Petrie\'s debut novel, \nThe Drifter\n (see my review), was absolutely fantastic, a thriller with a great plot and terrific character development. Featuring war veteran Peter Ash, a complex, intense protagonist, the book even made "honorable mention" on my list of the best books I read in 2015.Petrie\u2014and Peter Ash\u2014have returned in \nBurning Bright\n, a book with even more crackling action and moments of quiet emotion. It might even be better than its predecessor. And here\'s one thing: I know that blurbs from other authors is just a marketing thing, but when Lee Child is willing to say, "Lots of characters get compared to my own Jack Reacher, but Peter Ash is the real deal," that carries some weight. (Plus, it\'s true.)Ash served in Iraq and Afghanistan, returning home after multiple tours of duty plagued by "white static"\u2014serious claustrophobia brought on from the traumatic stress of combat. It\'s so bad he can barely stand to be indoors for more than a few minutes, and even being outside when the sky is really cloudy gives him trouble. He has once again taken to a long-term hiking and camping trip, this time among the California redwoods, when he discovers he\'s not as alone as he thought\u2014he encounters a grizzly bear, a rare occurrence these days since most have vanished from that part of the country. His run-in with the bear doesn\'t approach \nThe Revenant\n territory, but it sends him up a tree with no gear and supplies, and just slightly worse for wear.Just as he\'s beginning to wonder if he\'ll have to stay in the tree for days until the bear gets distracted, he notices a climbing rope hanging in the tree, what he discovers is a series of ropes hanging from adjacent trees. What better plan that to follow this course, of sorts, and see where it leads? So there he is, traveling from tree to tree, until he finds a hanging platform. All is safe now. Then he finds another danger\u2014a woman with a gun pointed at him. And next? Men with guns. Firing.June Cassidy is a feisty, Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist known for her investigations into data security. She\'s been on the run from men purporting to be with the federal government, who are interested in what she knows about her mother\'s groundbreaking computer software research, since her mother died in an accident not long ago. She doesn\'t know what her mother was working on, but it must have been something big, because these men keep coming. She doesn\'t know how to escape them, but discovers Peter might be the help she needs.As the two team up to figure out who is after June, and what they want, they encounter a series of ever-more-determined men wanting to capture and/or kill them. It\'s going to take toughness, serious smarts, and pretty mad skills with firearms and getaway cars, none of which seems like a problem for the duo. But as they begin to uncover a serious operation afoot which makes June question whom she can trust, and Peter has to fight both the static and those after June, they may be in more trouble than they think.Once again, Petrie has written a thriller which is the stuff of which great action films are made. The opening chapters are full of serious pulse-pounding action, but he doesn\'t give character and plot development short shrift. Peter Ash is so much more than meets the eye, but even though he can drop more than a few assailants at once, he still has a lot of problems of his own, not to mention the adrenaline and, perhaps even a little thrill, which comes from taking care of those looking to do him and June harm. And in June, Petrie has created a terrific foil for Peter.If you like thrillers which not only ratchet up your pulse but leave you marveling at the author\'s storytelling skill as well, pick up \nBurning Bright\n. (You can read that one first if you want, but \nThe Drifter\n is equally excellent.) My hope is that Petrie\u2014and Peter Ash\u2014will be back soon, and will get the public recognition they deserve.NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP Putnam provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making this available! See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.\n         ', u'\n           \n           June Cassidy is pushing 30 working as a freelancer writing mostly on issues of privacy in the electronic age for Public Investigations. Having recently lost her mother who had been a brilliant scientist working on classified software for the Department of Defense, June was heart broken that she died from injuries sustained by a hit and run driver. Still in a daze from the shock of losing her mother, she rode her single-speed Schwinn at a slow pace to pick up a jolt of coffee to start her day. Suddenly June became alert and highly suspicious when a large black SUV pulled up beside her with some menacing looking men inside. Claiming to be the feds, they demanded she stop and get in their vehicle for questioning. For many years June was constantly told by her mom, by her selfdefense instructor, don\u2019t ever get in the car; so that wasn\u2019t going to happen, not today, until they zapped her with an electric stun gun. Action-packed, a gripping engrossing story with menacing aggressive characters on the hunt, Burning Bright is unputdownable never letting up for one nanosecond.\n', u"\n           \n           This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.This book really grabbed my attention from the start with almost non-stop excitement. It almost felt like I had been thrown into an action movie and I loved every minute of it. Before I even knew it, I had read a large part of the book. The pace of the story did eventually slow down but the excitement never stopped because I couldn't stop trying to figure out how things would work out. This was such a great read.Peter Ash is veteran dealing with PTSD which causes him to feel claustrophobic anytime he is indoors. He deals with it as best he can which usually means that he tries to stay out of buildings as much as possible. I find Peter to be a very interesting and unique character. He thinks quick and knows his limitations. June is a reporter that finds herself hiding from a group of men that attempted to kidnap her. June meets Peter and they start to work together to figure out why she has been targeted. June's character really complimented Peter's nicely. Their personalities meshed perfectly and they seemed to be able to work smoothly together almost from the moment that they met. This book has no shortage of action. Peter and June find themselves in the middle of several intense situations and I never know exactly how things would turn around. I was never quite sure exactly who the bad guy was so I didn't really trust any of the characters besides Peter and June and of course, Lewis, who I was very happy to see make an appearance in this book. The story took quite a few twists and turns with many unexpected moments.I would recommend this book to others. This is the second book in the Peter Ash series and while it could be read as a stand alone, readers will probably appreciated the background knowledge from the first book. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in this exciting series.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Penguin Group - Putnam G.P. Putnam's Sons via NetGalley and First to Read.Initial ThoughtsThis book sucked me in immediately. It started out like an action movie with one exciting event following the next. The mystery kept me guessing until the very end. \n         ", u"\n           \n           This is the second book in the Peter Ash series, it was a great read. Well plotted story, good character development, moves along at a good pace. June's mother, a brilliant programmer was a victim of a hit and run accident, now someone Is trying to kidnap June in effort to get access to June's mother's program. Peter Ash a veteran with PTDS meets up with June, together they try to figure out who wanted June's mother dead to get her last program.Peter and June with a full cast of characters pursue and are pursued making for an action packed read. I received this book from Penguins First to Read, for an honest review.\nThis review was originally posted on The Pfaeffle Journal\n\n", u'\n           \n           Conspiracy-theory, fugitive from the law, car chase books aren\'t my usual choice of reading material but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot pulls you in immediately with June getting kidnapped and then escaping shortly after her mother, government contractor working on a top secret tech project, get killed in a hit and run "accident." June hides in an old research facility in some redwoods in the middle of nowhere when a "shell-shocked" war veteran named Peter stumbles across her while trying to escape from a bear. It was love at first sight for Peter and he offers June his protection. Together they go on the run, trying to figure out who is after June and why. Their quick wit and banter make them entertaining and enduring. I would definitely recommend.

I have not read most of these authors, so I was kind of expecting to read another fantastic box set but with this one I was entertained, but not blown away. I was amazed when I found some of the stories I was able to put the book down. I thought they would hit a stride so that I wanted to keeps reading their future books. A few of these books are awesome, and they are well written and the plot to each of these books are full of twists and turns. They are well developed characters that capture your interest from the beginning of each of these stories. The emotional and sexual situations leaps from the pages and keeps you reading long after you should have cut your lights off to sleep! Each book you may find yourself cheering for them one moment and wanting to smack them along the back of the head the next. Each of these couple will have decisions to make and they don't just involve them being together. Their dialogue is passionate, realistic, and you will love the interaction between the main characters, the chemistry is scorching hot and they leap off the page with life that's so real. The scenes are vivid, beautiful and dynamic with lots of passion. I knew that this box set would be a great read. I love to read a story where two characters who have such intense chemistry. Of course their chemistry will eventually give way to their attraction and love. It was amaing to read how they burned for each other and how each gets their HEA.

I found myself smiling at times while other times I was sad while reading these stories. Some of these stories have a lot of violence with attitude.

However, if you're a fan of things that is naughty with sexual tension and lots action you may want to read this interesting paranormal box set with interesting characters and an intriguing storylines, you may like this box set, I did.

Some of my favourites are in here, but so are some I've never come across before and it's a great way to discover 'new to you' authors. The stories too are a mix of styles, some with more substance than others and vary in length from the really short (1 chapter) to full-length novels (29 chapters) and a couple of novellas in between, so there's something in here for everyone. For assorted reasons, I haven't had time to read the whole set, but I have read two of the stories and when I have more time I'll go back, read the others and update my review as I go.1 - The Blood of Angels - Selena Kitt2 - Deadly Captive - Bianca Sommerland3 - The Witch's Vampire - Jamie Brumfield4 - Taste for Blood - Tilly Greene5 - Bite Marks - Rebecca Royce - 5 starsShy human author George Perkins has been in love with were-wolf hunter Trudy Rulan since she first appeared behind the Honky Tonk's bar in the small town of Hedy, Texas and despite her continually refusing to go out with him, he knows she was born to be his wife. She's already turned him down eight times, but he had to give it another go and this time, good job he was sitting down, she said yes and his heart soared. She agreed to have dinner with him when her shift ended, if he was still able after his friend Ryan's bachelor party that night. Unfortunately, he wasn't, and not for the reason you might expect. On his way out of the club he was attacked by a rogue vampire but his friends found him before it was too late.... and opened a whole new can of worms.After witnessing the brutal murder of their father, Trudy and her brother Devin had been on the run for years. They split up to make it harder for the were-wolves to track them and Trudy knew she really shouldn't get involved with George, but she really likes him and it hurt when she got a message from his friends cancelling their date. Then she got word from her brother to run again, and she did, but she couldn't stop thinking about George...I'm not going to give spoilers, but there's a lot of story packed into this novella length book. Rebecca Royce is one of my favourite authors and I've read almost everything she's written over the years. 'Bite Marks' is something a little different to her other paranormal romances and slightly more unusual than the typical vampire romance since neither of the two main characters, suspense writer George and were-wolf hunter turned hunted Trudy, start out that way, it happens on the rocky road to true love. Written to be a stand alone, rather than part of a series, this terrific paranormal romance is a love story which has everything you could want including the HEA and is equally as good as everything else I've read by her. At times, it had me on the edge of my seat, made me laugh and cry and hope and finally sigh with relief when there was a happy ending after-all. It also made me angry at Trudy's brother Devin for the life he forced her to live. I loved the characters and there are several who could easily have their own stand alone stories, and I'd love to read them. This book left me with a smile on my face and I absolutely loved it.6 - Everlasting Hope - Onne Andrews - 3 StarsThis short story about a vampire assassin, true love that has lasted a lifetime even if the lovers are forced to be apart, and a brother's betrayal, is the first thing I've read by this author and I'm in two minds about whether or not it'll be the last. Not that the writing wasn't good, it was, the story too, up to a point. That would be the point when the heroine, Hope Sitwell Abernathy jumps into bed with the assassin (name withheld to avoid spoilers). I know it was to get the love of her life back after 25 years of forced separation and the payoff is an eternal happily ever after, but cheating is a trigger for me and I don't like it. If not for that, I would have given this story 3.5 stars, and I've only knocked off .5 star for the cheating because it was for a worthy cause and the only way. Under normal circumstances, I would have just stopped reading it, but the daring plan grabbed my attention and held it, although I doubt the same would be true for a longer story. Too much sex and not enough substance for my taste.7 - Club Crimson: Skye's Fall - Dottie Wilson8 - Misssexfang - Indy Mon9 - Loving Damien - Brooke Adams10 - Bordello of Vampire Pleasure - Lynda Belle11 - Blackmailed by the Vampire - Kitty Jones12 - Music in Her Blood - Indy Mon13 - Ash: Before Dawn (Native American Gay Vampire Romance) - Skye EagledayI was given a copy of this box set in exchange for an honest review and although I have mixed feelings about one of the books, and I absolutely loved the other one, there are a couple more of my favourite authors in this set and I'll definitely be reading their stories, along with the others, when I have more time. But, although I love Skye Eagleday, I may not read her book simply because gay romance isn't really my thing. Having said that, love is love, and it is novella length, so I'll think about it. Until then, I've split the difference and given this set 4 stars.\n", u"\n           \n           Title: Love At First Bite\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Series: 13 Books Excite Spice Vampire Author's: The Blood of Angels ~ Selena Kitt Deadly Captive ~ Bianca Sommerland The Witch's Vampire ~ Jami Brumfield Taste for Blood ~ Tilly Greene Bite Marks ~ Rebecca Royce Everlasting Hope ~ Onne Andrews Club Crimson: Skye's Fall ~ Dottie Wilson MissSexFang ~ Indy Mon Loving Damien ~ Brooke Adams Bordello of Vampire Pleasure 1 ~ Lynda Belle Blackmailed by the Vampire ~ Kitty Jones Music in her Blood ~ Indy Mon Ash: Before Dawn (Native American Gay Vampire Romance) ~ Skye EagledayReviewer: Ingrid Stephanie Jordan\xa0 My Score:\xa0 #5Stars\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661\u2022\xb0\u2022\u2661I'm sorry to say I was only able to read 1 book, I plan on the rest soon. \u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aaTitle: Bite MarksAuthor: Rebecca Royce\xa0 #5Stars\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Genre: #PRN\xa0 #Vampire #WereWolvesOhhhh My Goodness anything from this lady is golden.

She finds herself more and more drawn into human actions and when she meets one that can see her, she uses her annual wish so that she can experience what it's like to be human for one day. I really enjoyed this story. It was very sweet experiencing everything through Zeph's eyes, especially once she became human. -Deadly Captive-Bianca Sommerland-1 StarLydia becomes conscious completely chained up and not remembering anything. The first thing she sees is Joe. This story should have had a warning on it. It starts right off with a situation I don\u2019t care to read about and gets worse from there. I did manage to finish the story out of morbid curiosity but the story really wasn\u2019t for me.-The Witch's Vampire-Jami Brumfield-2 StarsJust after her mother succumbs to cancer, Sophie Waters is told that not only is she a witch, but she is to be the town\u2019s next witch doctor. When she takes off in despair, she runs into Giovanni Mancuso, the vampire prince. I started out liking this story, but the farther I got, the less I liked it. I didn\u2019t like the different character switched Sophia seemed to have. I also didn\u2019t like how the POVs changed from paragraph to paragraph. I made it through most of the story, but when the Greek mythology got changed up, I had to stop.-Bite Marks Rebecca Royce-5 StarsGeorge is a writer whose determined that Trudy, a bartender at a local bar, is to be his future wife. If only she\u2019d finally go on a date with him. Just as she finally accepts his request, he is bitten by a vampire and left for dead. I really liked this story. It was very fast-paced and kept my interest. Trudy is a real spit-fire. I especially liked her characters. She\u2019s a no-nonsense type of person and finally decides to take what she wants.I read 4 of the stories in this anthology. I loved two of them and really disliked two of them. That\u2019s odd for me. Usually I tend to like most every story, but that wasn\u2019t the case this time. Because of that, I haven\u2019t finished the anthology.

This trilogy is called Dark Disciple, and it focuses on Mina, a character that was introduced in the War of the Souls trilogy. For those who know nothing about Dragonlance lore, this review is not going to make a whole lot of sense, and I feel compelled to tell you that there are series spoilers in this review.In the last book in the trilogy we discovered that Mina was actually a god - all this time she thought the gods were working through her, but it was really her power that was working. She was created at the beginning of time as a god of Light, but as her existence upset the balance between Darkness and Light, she was put into eternal slumber. She awoke when Takhisis stole the world, which precipitated the War of the Souls. Takhisis convinced Mina to work for Darkness, and Mina never discovered that she was meant to be a goddess on the side of Light. It's no wonder that at the beginning of Amber and Blood, she goes crazy and appears as the aspect of a six-year-old child, before she became a vehicle of Takhisis' will. Amber and Blood follows Mina's journey to Godshome, where she is drawn for some inexplicable purpose. She is joined by Brother Rhys, a monk, and Nightshade, a kender (with common sense), and their dog Atta. The choices she makes could upset the balance of power in the universe, but no one seems to no what she might do.I really only finished this book because I wanted to see how Weis would end the trilogy. The book itself was definitely not great. I enjoyed it for the Dragonlance storyline, but even that really wasn't enough to make me care about what happened. It's disappointing, because I know that Weis can do better, at least I have read better books by her and Tracy Hickman together (The Deathgate Cycle is a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy). But the latest Dragonlance books, especially this series, have really been a let-down.\n         ", u'\n           \n           Well well well. Let\'s see here...I started to like this book better than the first two books of the trilogy. Not great. But decent.Then it descended into a bunch of nonsense. Here are some of the highlights.1) Frequent exchanges between the lead character (as a child) and a kender that read like this:"Yes you are.""No I\'m not!""Are too!""Am not!""Are too!""Am not!""Are too!""Am not!"And so forth...2) Hey! Did you know there\'s a dog in this book?! It\'s name is Atta, and it\'s black and white and cute and loyal and fluffy and defends its master and, oh, it\'s just great! It\'s a dog!Seriously. Enough with the dog.3) A "Hollywood ending" that you probably saw a mile away. The only saving grace of it was that I thought that\'s how the "War of Souls" trilogy would end. Instead they dragged it out over the course of six books. Come to think of it, that part of it actually sucks as well.In short, I\'d suggest not reading this trilogy. You probably have something more useful you could be doing with your time.\n         ', u"\n           \n           I was astounded by how terrible this was. It really made me afraid-- what if all these books have been equally terrible, and for some reason Ive just been blind to the truth til now? I mean, I've dutifully read practically every new Dragonlance for the last 15 years. Am I fucking retarded or was this just extra terrible or what?\n         ", u"\nAmber and Blood is a great book about Mina's struggle to accept the knowledge that she is a god as well as her choice of which side (Light or Darkness) to join. Her journey to Godshome with Rhys, the monk, and Nightshade, the kender, is everything that is expected from a Dragonlance book.

A tough broad who could have stepped straight out of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s repertoire, she has spent nearly forty years as the legendary personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman, where she works with socialites, stars, and ordinary women off the street. She has helped many find their true selves through clothes, frank advice, and her own brand of wisdom. She is trusted by the most discriminating persons\u2014including Hollywood\u2019s top stylists\u2014to tell them what looks best. But Halbreich\u2019s personal transformation from a cosseted young girl to a fearless truth teller is the greatest makeover of her career.<br /> \xa0 A Chicago native, Halbreich moved to Manhattan at twenty after marrying the dashing Sonny Halbreich, a true character right out of Damon Runyon who liked the nightlife of New York in the fifties. On the surface, they were a great match, but looks can be deceiving; an unfaithful Sonny was emotionally distant while Halbreich became increasingly anguished. After two decades, the fraying marriage finally came undone. Bereft without Sonny and her identity as his wife, she attempted suicide. <br /> After she began the frightening process of reclaiming herself and started therapy, Halbreich was offered a lifeline in the form of a job at the legendary luxury store Bergdorf Goodman. Soon, she was asked to run the store\u2019s first personal shopping service. It was a perfect fit.<br /><br /> Meticulous, impeccable, hardworking, elegant, and\u2014most of all\u2014delightfully funny, Halbreich has never been afraid to tell it to her clients straight. She won\u2019t sell something just to sell it. If an outfit or shoe or purse is too expensive, she\u2019ll dissuade you from buying it. As Halbreich says, \u201cThere are two things nobody wants to face: their closet and their mirror.\u201d She helps women do both, every day.', u'7552', u'3.53', u'2811', [(u'to-read', 2918), (u'currently-reading', 89), (u'memoir', 74), (u'non-fiction', 59), (u'fashion', 55)], [u'\n           \n           Most of the book was completely vapid. If one is not careful, it is really easy to boil its message down to "Who cares if I sucked as a mother or attempted suicide to get the attention of my estranged husband, when I get to dress the \'Sex and the City\' girls in my later years...even though I don\'t watch TV and don\'t know who they are?"I was entertained enough to get through the whole book and really enjoyed the final chapter. I was inspired to go through my closets and reorganize my dresser while finished listening to the book so I guess it was a win after all.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Read this and other reviews at Ampersand Read.The first few chapters are pure sumptuous reading delight. The fabrics she dresses her clients in, the formal dinners her parents threw for guests when Halbreich was a child, the food, the palazzo pants, the shoes (oh my!) paint a vivid picture for the reader. Halbreich lived a charmed childhood, and from an outsider\'s perspective, a charmed life. Descriptions of a life "doing as [she was] told" get darker as the narrative, and Halbreich\'s life, go on, but it is made in interesting for the reader.Overall, thought, I found it to be a bit piecemeal. There are some wonderful moments. The first few chapters, as I mentioned, are wonderfully descriptive. They read like colorful fiction. As Halbreich and her biographer zoom through her life, it gets choppy. Halbreich faces challenges: a marriage unhappy from the start, a dependent, lonesome relationship with both parents, a messy separation and subsequent admittance to a psychiatric hospital, and arms-reach relationships with both of her children. But it\'s all delivered rather one-note. I read scenes about her desperately seeking attention from her booze-swilling husband and domestic scenes between her and her beloved housekeeper in the same pitch. The timeline is patchy. She skips years, then methodically sorts through weeks and months (I realize there have to be fast-forwards in biographies - no one wants to read the day-by-day on anyone, famous or not). Her thoughts read as very scattered, and out of the blue she\'ll jump to a client she helped recently, then back to her fractured life after a fractured marriage. One chapter is so name-drop heavy that my eyes skimmed a bit (maybe to someone tuned into the classic movie/fashion scene would enjoy that more than I).\n         ', u'\n           \n           I\'ll start with somewhat embarrassing revelation : I mistakenly thought I was going to be reading a memoir of a recovering alcoholic...what I got instead (thankfully) was the journey of a charming woman who\'s life reflects the tremendous changes in our country in the last 60 years. The introduction starts at the end of Betty Halbreich\'s journey which lead her to be the first personal shopper at the venerable Bergdorf Goodmans in New York City. While her job sounds intriguing, rewarding and, quite frankly, fun her growth from privileged Post War housewife to an independent self reliant trend setter is most compelling. I think Betty\'s story is reflective of many women of that period, pampered, bored and unfulfilled. Wishing only for the attention of her husband, her marriage eventually falls apart due to his alcoholism and philandering. Left on her own for the first time as a woman in her 40\'s, Betty suffers a breakdown and in the process of recovery finds healing in one of her favorite pastimes, shopping. She elevates the experience of personal shopper to that of mother, therapist and sage. Ironically, her previous seemingly empty lifestyle perfectly prepared her to best serve her clients. A truly enjoyable read. I highly recommend it! I was given this book in Penguin\'s "first to read" program.\n', u'\n"I wanted to give my ladies fortitude in all things."Look, if you think reading the memoirs of someone who has been a personal shopper for rich women for nearly 40 years is silly, I\'m not going to try to convince you otherwise. But I thought it was delightful. Betty Halbreich was the child of rich but distant parents who showed their love by dressing her beautifully and making or buying gorgeous things. She married when she was young and very immature and had nothing to do all day but shop. (Yes, I know, she could have volunteered.) Her marriage disintegrated and she had to go to work. And she turned that knowledge of style and fit and aesthetics into a valuable service -- part shopper, part sociologist, part therapist. And she is still working at 86!"Too many people wear a label rather than what is becoming.""I am like the doctor: You confide in him, he diagnoses you, and then, when your time is up, he\'s on to the next case!""Mother never cooked--she was too busy smoking--but we always had the most marvelous food.""Nowadays everybody under fifty wants to be nude and everyone over fifty covered up like a nun.""I really dislike mirrors of all kinds and am known for leaving the house with my buttons askew and my clothes inside out.""Clothes were my playmates.""Deep down I was angry at my neediness. So I severed the cord with my own children early. . . . I literally threw both my children onto the subway at nine years old.

But those subjects aren\'t why she got the book deal.Lena Dunham is basing an HBO TV series on Halbreich.\n         ', u'\n           \n           Self serving for the most part. Some pathos when she talked about her childhood, but a lot of how fabulous I am going on.I love to shop but even for me a little shopping goes a long way.The missing voices were from her kids. I would love to hear their story.But one always applauds and 86 year old woman who is still vital and working each day.

What would death reveal to Satan which may surprise agony? What may joy surmise on pain that might recall God's support? What might greed and insanity bring to table worthy of discussion in peace's eyes? Where would loyalty stand should all others be permitted to share the same house?Flaubert embarks on a bold journey, by giving voice to these very boundless giants and drawing a territory around them by erecting three walls of formidable texture and strength, painted with magnanimous coats of deceptive prose and magnetic rhythm. Reverberating within their throes are three teeming groups of conversations - the unsettling yet hypnotizing exchange on continuity and termination between death and satan, the rising and falling chronicles of an assiduous man with a coal-black barbaric streak and the indefatigable affection of a gregarious maid towards her bountiful parrot. The stories have powerful mouthpieces and their innermost themes dance with vigor at Flaubert's deft call. One has to be a sworn cynic to deny Flaubert, his versatility and adroitness.But even the best architect in this world cannot lay claim (without sumptuous debate) on completeness of a house having chosen to withhold a fourth wall to his structure. The three walls, in this story, also could not undermine the importance of a fourth wall on my dwelling tastes. While the stories ran with unrestrained velocity, the stability that imparts gravitas to their colossal mass was missing. While I could sense Flaubert's great passion as a beaming halo behind his two characters, Julian in The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller and Felicite in A Simple Soul, the characters themselves did not assume a life of their own despite their manifold perditions. Regard me with pessimism if you wish but my limited observations indicate that the greatest characters have risen from the flames of failures and damnations. And Flaubert's miserly shower of these redemptive pulses on his characters seemed like outright injustice to their etching.I wish I had peppered a prayer on my lips, standing by Julian's hours of penance; may be, straightened a few wrinkles on the fatigued brows of Felicite's loneliness. Alas! my empathies quietly escaped from the open space of this house. But not before taking the idiosyncrasies of loulou surreptitiously in my bag, who went on to adorn the chief mantle in Julian Barnes'  Flaubert's Parrot !\n         ", u"\nJOHN CLEESE: I would like to register a complaint about this parrot, what I read about not half an hour ago in a Flaubert short story.MICHAEL PALIN: Oh yeah?

It's representing the Holy Ghost, that's what's wrong with it.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)\n", u'\n           \n           This collection of longish short stories is Gustave Flaubert\'s take on saints\' lives. The stories go chronologically back in time from 19th century France, to the Middle Ages, to the New Testament. This may be surprising from an author who wrote about people with less than moral lives and who was well known for being critical of the Catholicism of his time. However, the three stories contained in this book are brilliant.The first story, "Un coeur simple" (A Simple Heart), is about a saint who is in all ways an unknown, a nobody. Her name, F\xe9licit\xe9, is ironic, as her life of domestic servitude proves anything but felicitous. Lacking in education, she overflows with affection for her difficult mistress, Mme Aubain, and the two children of the family, Paul and Virginie. (These last are the names of the main characters of Paul Et Virginie, a novel which Flaubert mocks in Madame Bovary.) As the children eventually drop out of her life and her world shrinks around her, the one joy of her dull existence is a parrot which she names Loulou. She loves it so much that it eventually takes on a rather intense religious significance.The second story, "La l\xe9gende de Saint Julien l\'hospitalier" is a retelling of the life of a medieval saint. The child of doting parents, Julien very early on becomes addicted in a frighteningly sadistic way to the extermination of animals for sport, and becomes a great hunter. Having ignored a baleful warning issued by a miraculous stag, he commits a horrendous crime, and in penance renounces the world to become a hermit and a ferryman. Then a mysterious stranger comes to trouble him and the interaction between them is truly strange.The third story, "H\xe9rodias," is Flaubert\'s retelling of the beheading of St. John the Baptist. He goes over the biblical narrative but adds stunning visual descriptions, background details and minor characters to flesh it out. What links these three tales is a fascination with small, sparkling details. An exotic aura surrounds the stories, even when the setting is as unromantic as the Normandy of Flaubert\'s time. There is a sense of fatality which directs the lives of the respective saints to their inevitable conclusion, a scene of apotheosis. In all three cases, this is an ambiguous and even erotic, but ultimately unforgettable moment. Flaubert\'s tales are still influencing literature today. Loulou, the parrot of "A Simple Heart," was the inspiration for Julian Barnes\' Flaubert\'s Parrot, a comic detective novel mixed with abundant reflections on Flaubert\'s life and works. "Saint Julien" is quoted extensively in Yann Martel\'s Beatrice and Virgil which has its own bizarre and sadistic plot twists. "H\xe9rodias" is supposed to have influenced Salome by Oscar Wilde. I wonder what "l\'oncle Gustave," that irascible, inscrutable, lascivious, high-strung old curmudgeon, would think if he knew that his stories had fathered such progeny. Would he be surprised? Flattered? Amused? Maybe. But then again, maybe not. \n         ', u"\n           \n           Three miniatures of supreme craftmanship, the epitomy of Flaubert's art up to that time. And then like Ambrose Bierce some 40 years afterwards, Gustav crossed the border and joined a personal revolution, he got lost in his own post-modernism ( Bouvard et Pecuchet)\n         ", u'\n           \n           Este fue el \xfaltimo libro que public\xf3 en su vida Gustave Flaubert, m\xe1s all\xe1 de su extravagante proyecto aparecido p\xf3stumamente, y que se llam\xf3 \u201cBouvard y P\xe9cuchet\u201d. Estos tres cuentos vieron la luz en 1877, pero fueron escritos dos a\xf1os antes.La idea de Flaubert era darse un respiro y escribir algo m\xe1s fresco que la complicaci\xf3n a la que estaba sometido con Bouveard y P\xe9cuchet, y es por ello que decide publicarlos.Los tres cuentos est\xe1n ambientados en \xe9pocas bien distintas, el primero durante algunos a\xf1os atr\xe1s, durante sus d\xedas en el siglo XIX, el segundo es una historia medieval y el tercero en la \xe9poca de las historias b\xedblicas.De los tres cuentos, personalmente me quedo con \u201cUn coraz\xf3n sencillo\u201d, en primer lugar porque a\xfan recuerdo estar ley\xe9ndolo en un banco de espera de la Facultad de Humanidades mientras estudiaba Licenciatura en Letras y segundo porque me encantan los cuentos y novelas m\xe1s importantes de ese movimiento que se llam\xf3 Realismo.Cabe aclarar que el Realismo de Flaubert difiere en ciertos aspectos del de Balzac, por ejemplo, quien basaba muchas de sus novelas en el status social, en el dinero y en el poder que \xe9ste genera (\u201cEug\xe8nie Grandet\u201d y \u201cLa muchacha de los ojos de oro\u201d). Tal vez Stendhal con su \u201cRojo y negro\u201d tambi\xe9n se equipare a Balzac.En Flaubert, el Realismo se percibe especialmente en las costumbres de los personajes -casualmente, \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d tiene un subt\xedtulo: \u201cCostumbres de provincia\u201d-, en su modo de vida y en la manera tan detallada que ten\xeda Flaubert de describir a las personas y los objetos. Esa es la caracter\xedstica m\xe1s sobresaliente: el exagerado detalle de todo lo que uno \u201cve\u201d mientras lee. Flaubert describe las personas, su cabellera, las manos, la ropa, los vestidos, los zapatos, los animales, el interior de las casas, las partes del mobiliario, los adornos, los ambientes, los bosques, las calles, las plazas, los edificios, todo. Absolutamente todo.Y por \xfaltimo, si algo tiene bien marcado el Realismo es que a diferencia del divagante Romanticismo, todo lo que se narra tiene un principio, un medio y un final y se cuenta con una precisi\xf3n cronol\xf3gica sin falencias, adem\xe1s de dar fechas exactas, certeras. Ejemplo: "Un lunes, el 14 de julio de 1819\u2026" (p\xe1gina 29). Esto hace que el lector est\xe9 exactamente ubicado en espacio tiempo durante la lectura del texto.Respecto de \u201cTres cuentos\u201d, si bien las \xe9pocas son distintas, en todos los casos, hay un tema af\xedn a ellos y que todos comparten: el de la muerte.En los tres, Flaubert trabajan la cuesti\xf3n de la muerte que aplica a uno de sus personajes y no es un dato menor. Creo que es donde quiere inferir el significado de lo que narra.\u201cUn coraz\xf3n sencillo\u201d es realmente un cuento perfecto. Me encanta la descripci\xf3n que hace de su personaje principal, Felicitas, cuyo nombre contrasta con todas las penurias y miserias que tiene que vivir. Fiel, leal, trabajadora abnegada, Felicitas es exactamente opuesta a la quijotesca Madame Bovary forma parte del mundo que mejor sabe describir Flaubert: el de la burgues\xeda.Sinceramente, sostengo que es un cuento impecable, no tiene fallas. No hay nada en \xe9l que no dudas acerca de su perfecci\xf3n narrativa.En \u201cLa leyenda de San Juli\xe1n, el Hospitalario\u201d, el autor desarrolla toda una historia medieval con connotaciones de par\xe1bola y con un final que nos aporta un mensaje edificante acerca de Juli\xe1n, que es una mezcla de caballero andante y santo. Le encuentro a este cuento conexiones con algunas de las \u201cVidas imaginarias\u201d que nos narra Marcel Schwob.La vida de Juli\xe1n traza un curso exacto que muta de la crueldad a la redenci\xf3n y el cuento se cierra correctamente, sin fisuras.El \xfaltimo de los cuentos, \u201cHerod\xedas\u201d, es el que menos me atrajo. M\xe1s all\xe1 de los personajes de Herodes Antipas, Agripa y de Ioakannan, me recordaron mucho a \u201cSalom\xe9\u201d, esa obra en un solo acto escrita por Oscar Wilde sobre la muerte de San Juan Bautista, pero en l\xedneas generales, no desentona con las restantes historias narradas por Flaubert.En resumidas cuentas, \u201cTres cuentos\u201d es un libro brillantemente narrado, que se lee f\xe1cil y r\xe1pidamente y que est\xe1 escrito por ese inolvidable autor franc\xe9s que se llam\xf3 Gustave Flaubert.\n         '], 0]!!!![u'27672384', u'Las Legiones de ALA', u'396', u'\n14635259\nMaria Angeles Ichaso\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14635259.Maria_Angeles_Ichaso\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2015', u'4', u'18', u'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', u'La expansion del integrismo islamista en estos ultimos anos vista a traves del recorrido de un joven tunecino desde sus montanas de Krumiria hasta Tunez capital, pasando por Italia, Alemania, Espana, Siria y Afganistan, y de sus companeros de guerra santa.

Excerpt: ... during which time no other food was taken. In addition to the skim-milk, acetate of potash, in twenty-grain doses in water, was prescribed thrice daily; but, as this produced dyspeptic symptoms, it was discontinued for a while and then recommenced; but, as it again disagreed, it was given up, and the citrate of potash prescribed instead. Near the end of April, the patient, being convalescent, went to Brighton to recruit his strength, and afterwards started to spend the summer in visiting the shores of the Mediterranean in a yacht, much to the improvement of his general health. This case would have been rapidly cured if the skim-milk treatment had been begun early in the disease, when the turpentine was prescribed. In the third chapter of the present work I have already laid down rules for the administration of the skim-milk treatment, to which I must refer for information as to its application in Bright's disease. I will only add that to ensure success it should be most scrupulously and strictly followed. The skimmilk should be taken exclusively until either the albumen has disappeared from the urine altogether, or is very considerably reduced, and the dropsy removed. Then, as a middle course, curd should be added to the skim-milk regimen. Afterwards, when the patient is sufficiently convalescent, a mixed diet may be prescribed; but the skim-milk must at the same time be continued for a considerable period. When a change is made, it is better, at first, to allow a little brown bread thrice daily, and after the lapse of a few days, a little lean beef-steak or mutton chop, with green vegetables or a little well-cooked potato. But great care should be taken in restricting the daily quantity of solid food to a moderate amount.

I generously gave this series a 3. \n         ", u'\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           This book was BEYOND repetitive. What got me the most was towards the end when they watched the video from her mother and then in the next chapter or two the characters said "I think my mom thought this", "I think your mom thought that" well YES she did. How do we know this? Oh because she explicitly said so in her video to you. Thanks for not actively listening guys.

If you have a child that is not too sensitive to scary stories, this one is a suspenseful read. Little George sees a strange object hanging on the wall of his Dad's study. When he asks his Dad what it is, Dad tell him it is a Witch's Hand and the harrowing tale of how he obtained it. Fortunately, not all is at it seems and George finds himself asking from more by the end of Dads story.I read this book to multiple groups grades 1-3 children at my daughter's school. Overall, the story kept their attention and enjoyed guessing if the Witch's Hand was real. Some kids found the pictures of the Witch to be a bit scary and admittedly, the story is a rather creepy. Not for really sensitive kids. The story ends on a light note but still, my 7 year old daughter was a bit creeped out when I read it to her before bed :)\n         ", u"\n           \n           Absolutely LOVE this book.

Gabriel argues that there is no all-encompassing totality: that the world, in the traditional sense of a domain of all domains, cannot exist. Yet, he convincingly shows that this does not entail ontological nihilism. Rather, he argues that the non-existence of the world entails an infinity of domains and shows that this motivates a general realism - we can know things in themselves because our knowledge of things in themselves is itself part of these things. This ontology hinges on Gabriel's concept of fields of sense, which shows that, fundamentally, he opposes the idea that mathematics or the natural sciences could ever replace a richer philosophical understanding of what there is and how we know about it.", u'33', u'3.00', u'1', [], [], 0]!!!![u'31633061', u'Therapeutics of the Eye and Ear: An Elementary Manual', u'236', u'\n6064396\nCharles Harrison Vilas\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6064396.Charles_Harrison_Vilas\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'2016', u'5', u'20', u'Palala Press', u'This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Written in 1745 by Saint Alphonsus Liguori in Italian, this translation has been kept as specific as possible to the original but tries to "transpose the genius of the Italian language into the American idiom". The booklet is stamped with an Imprimatur. There are 31 "Visits" included here, one for each day of a month. Each devotion contains a few prayers which are identical every day and two which are specific to each day\'s particular reading. A visit proceeds as follows: Introductory prayer (the same every day), The Visit (there are 31 of these, each praises the Lord, tells stories and speaks of the Host actually being Our Lord), Spiritual Communion (the same every day. The prayers starts "My Jesus, I believe You are really here in the Blessed Sacrament."), a "Visit with Mary" (there are 31 of these and though they are brief each one pronounces the glory of the whys of adoration of Mary and a prayer directly to her. And finally the Concluding Prayer which is the same everyday and is a consecration prayer to Mary. I\'m thinking this can be used two ways, one, as obviously intended to visit the Blessed Sacrament and recite the prayer devotion every day for a month. Or two, when you have time to stay behind after Mass or visit a Church that is open to the public continually visit the Blessed Sacrament and recite the prayer devotion for whatever number of the month it is, for example on July 4th you would read "The Fourth Visit.". Of course, thirdly, the book would be useful for participation in Eucharistic Adoration.

Masterpiece!\n         ', u'\n           \n           I really enjoy St Alphonsus de Ligouri, but this was text was not as good as others he has written. It is ok, but seems more like a prayer guide and offers little depth. If that was its purpose, i.e. A prayer guide, then it is very good. But if one is looking for more depth, then they may wish to choose another of his books.\n         ', u'\n           \n           LOVE this book! It is absolutely amazing!!! It is so beautifully written! There are no other words for it - just amazing! Read it if you possibly can! I wanted to turn around and read it again and again.

It\u2019s so great that someone wrote this book! And the lessons are so important! So I put them in a list so that I could always refer back to these godly teachings on purity!On Female Sexuality*women\u2019s sexual needs are universal. girls are like robots, they are all the same. what are lesbians again?*except I forgot that there are terrible women who apparently have sexual feelings like men. real women have no sexual desires, and they\u2019d never think of pursuing men. that would suggest that women are equal to men, and that\u2019s devil talk*since you shouldn\u2019t be having sex anyway we won\u2019t get into birth control or STIs. three paragraphs is all you need honey*and since you shouldn\u2019t be having sex we definitely won\u2019t mention birth control that girls can use. CONDOMS ARE ALL THERE IS AND EVER SHALL BE*yeah it would be bad if you were well-informed about safe sex. education will be the death of us all*there is no extramarital sex that exists without shame. SHAAAAAAAME*you do not need to know about rape, masturbation, divorce, or birth control within marriage. what do you want, for us to give you the keys to hell?On Rape Women Who Have Succumbed to Satan [TW: Rape](view spoiler)[*girls are the victims of Satan, not the boys who coerced or pressured them into sex. men will have sex with anything that moves, so they really can\u2019t be culpable for this behavior*boys will be boys, by the way. the groom wears black for a reason*it\u2019s only abuse if it happened when you were a kid. that\u2019s why we wrote to you specifically at the end of the book*but \u2018rape\u2019 is such a strong word, so let\u2019s just call it a personal failure. there is no sex you can have where you don\u2019t have responsibility, unless you were a child, like in the former bullet point*not our fault you weren\u2019t abstinent. (hide spoiler)]On Female Purity*you are a valuable girl\u2014but only if other girls aren\u2019t. consider yourself a thing instead of a person, like a china cup. don\u2019t you feel so special? no? well, then think about other girls like styrofoam cups so that you will know that God made you to be a better thing than them*honey your boobs are going to hell. shame on you for wearing a push-up bra while reading this book, don\u2019t you know that you are making yourself a temptation to men?*you are what you wear. and that outfit definitely indicates that you have a thriving sex lifeOn Marriage*good news, if your parents pick your husband for you all will go well! they know everything*and also your parents are like little gods so listen to them. this truth will set you free*don\u2019t talk to boyfriends about periods. periods are inherently sexual and you must act as though you never have one*NEVER DISCUSS MARRIAGE WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND. do it after you\u2019re engaged, so he can\u2019t back out*having married sex is kind of like getting stuck in your pantry. that is why the perfect word to describe the experience is \u2018wedged\u2019*the best sex of ever is like the kind Jewish Bible people had, where a girl had to look hot for her husband and perform her important duty of being his most precious object on a chair while he built her a house and then kidnapped her, maybe even in the middle of the night, to get the sexy times on. DON\u2019T YOU FIND THE PATRIARCHAL ROMANCE INVIGORATING? On Womanhood*all girls want to be mothers someday. girls who don\u2019t want to be mothers will never ever have sex so we won\u2019t bother mentioning them*labor is \u2018ouchy.\u2019 that\u2019s the best word to use during this most sincere of memoirs when recalling a daughter\u2019s birth*a girl who loses the ability to reproduce basically has no purpose or joy in life anymore. so you better not get a hysterectomy or we\u2019ll shoot you*women who don\u2019t objectify themselves according to the standard\u2019s of this book are complete trash. this book comes from GOD are you saying you are not trash?*ugh, women who have difficult relationships and broken hearts are just garbage. DON\u2019T THESE GARBAGE WOMEN KNOW THAT MEN WANT PURE WIVES SOMEDAY?On Good Role Models* only use Bible verses where women have stumbled (although their lovers haven\u2019t). it\u2019s not like the Bible has a bias towards men, right? because it\u2019s not like it was\u2026 only written by\u2026 men\u2026*all of our successful romantic relationships will be examples from nineteenth century romance novels. they are so relatable to the modern world and not problematic at all*in addition, all evidence regarding how slutty clothing makes you a slutty person will be drawn from nineteenth century romance novels. back in the good old days when women could be oppressed without them complaining about it*it is right and good to discuss this one unnamed girl\u2019s sex life in detail probably without her permission! hallelujah for gossiping in the Lord\u2019s name*it is also right and good to talk about another girl\u2019s slutty behavior on her Facebook page. who cares if I asked for her permission? doing this for JesusOn Bad Role Models*LET US SHAME ORPAH! we had no desire to actually open a Bible and find out what her name was, and since she didn\u2019t get a book of the Bible named after her or be a king\u2019s grandma, her personal choice to build a life that was best for her indicates that her life was TERRIBLE! *let us brutally criticize single mothers as a lesson to others! single mothers deserve no compassion! they are loose women! burn them!*if you don\u2019t wait \u2018til marriage then your out-of-wedlock baby will go to hell.  no one will ever want to associate with your child of regret and bad decisions because yay stigmaMisc. Tips on Being a Christian*the literal interpretation of Genesis trumps evolution and glorifies the victimization of women again! yay!*according to C.S. Lewis, horses are better than lizards. God doesn\u2019t love you if you like lizards because they are sinful*YOU DO NOT NEED RESOURCES OTHER THAN WISE CHRISTIAN WOMEN. you do not need counseling, you do not need professional help, you do not need to see anyone other than your mom or your pastor or your older sister because you need to keep Jesus in your lifeThank you Jesus for keeping us pure through the supernatural truths presented in this book! Gosh, this was so great!\u2026Okay, real talk. I\u2019d give this book maybe 1.5 stars. It isn\u2019t a complete waste of time, I\u2019d say\u2014when there\u2019s good stuff, there\u2019s good stuff. It\u2019s important to remember that purity isn\u2019t just a matter of \u2018not having sex\u2019 but keeping your mind and heart in the right place when it comes to a relationship with God and others. However, it\u2019s also notable that this book often gets is point across by asking girls to internalize shame regarding some of their own behavior and, indeed, shame other women for the same reasons. Nothing is written quite as coarsely as I did above\u2014also, at some points I was just making fun of the writing. But it\u2019s true that in expecting the readers to accept and believe the \u2018truth\u2019 written in each chapter, very little effort was put into creating nuance in the lessons. By writing as a woman to women, the responsibility of men in sexual relationships was downplayed. If she didn\u2019t castigate a boyfriend\u2019s behavior, the narrator as good as condoned it.By writing about teen pregnancy in a negative light, we were led to equate unwed sex with unwed pregnancy. That\u2019s why I had the power to suggest that such a child was the living embodiment of sin. (Which is horrible, by the way.)By comparing women to objects, even \u201cprecious\u201d objects like china cups, women and their sexuality were reduced to a level of subhumanity. Women became things in the narrative of purity.The lack of nuance leaves these doors open for me to criticize. These doors are left open for beliefs that, since unaddressed, can be interpreted as true from the text. And so this book leaves a lot of room for the people who read and learn from it to accept that demeaning, blaming, and dehumanizing women is okay. Especially if you want to live a Christian lifestyle.I can say, after reading this through, that I am afraid of people who believe that this is how we should live as Christians. Women should not tear down women.That is all.\n         ', u"\n           \n           This was yet another dud, I mean, book that was recently given to me by a Christian woman who knows we are Atheists but hoped my 19 year old daughter would read them. After the daughter turned 50 Shades of Red and Purple and blasted enough angry steam rise off the top of her head to outblow a volcano, I backed away to throw these things away (lest some innocent person accidentally read this trash) then decided to have a peek at the Dark side, the sexual and dating advice 21st century religious fanatics follow that keeps them safely in the Dark Ages or Ancient Times. Dannah Gresh has got it down to an art form. Dannah is definitely drinking the dark ages koolaid here. I believe they might have removed her clitoris at birth. She is completely convinced that females are nonsexual beings who do not get horny (heh, heh, heh, we could teach her a few things couldn't we?) but are taken advantage of by those devious men. She has a hymen fetish that really rises to the level of mental illness. Sexual purity is highly overrated. Here are the facts. Girls have a clitoris which serves only one purpose- to give us intense orgasms. We don't pee through it and we don't pass babies through it. It is there ONLY for our sexual pleasure. Evolution has been very, very good to us. Patriarchal sexist men know this and it worries them. That is why many of them seek to cut it off girls. Other men try to use fear (God will get mad) to rein in female sexual pleasure. We can have multiple orgasms at any age. I am 53 and can have over 15 in a 24 hour period. A real man like my Atheist husband is delighted with this and willing to use tongue, lips, fingers, penis and vibrator to rock my world. Christian men are scared shitless as are those men in other patriarchal cults so they use an imaginary god and imaginary Jesus to get women in line to be controlled.It is sad to see women writing garbage that turns her sisters into property to be bought by a man and deflowered and kept as his property. There is nothing here to say the groom should wear white or that safe sex prior to marriage is good. It is females as property carried into the new century.This is seriously unhealthy and abnormal. \n         "], 0]!!!![u'28592688', u'Legends and Myths of the Aboriginal Indians of British Guiana', u' ', u'\n703918\nWilliam Henry Brett\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/703918.William_Henry_Brett\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'35715759', u'Das Experiment: Die neue Weltordnung', u' ', u'\n17038736\nTeil2 Swen Alman\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17038736.Teil2_Swen_Alman\n0.0\n0\n0\n', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'0', u'0.00', u'0', [], [], 0]!!!![u'15713522', u'Lily Liver Series', u'24', u'\n435640\nSusan Swain\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n\n\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/435640.Susan_Swain\n3.81\n281\n73\n', u'2012', u'', u'', u'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', u"The Lily Liver Series of rhyming stories introduces dalmatians Lily Liver and Two Pi R.
